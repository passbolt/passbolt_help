### Manually creating first admin user

Once the Helm chart is deployed, you can create your first user by running the following command:

```bash
kubectl exec -it  <passbolt-pod-name> -- /bin/bash -c "su -s /bin/bash -c \"bin/cake passbolt register_user -u <email> -f <firstname> -l <lastname> -r admin\" www-data"
```

It will output a link similar to the below one that can be pasted on the browser to finalize user registration:
```bash

```
