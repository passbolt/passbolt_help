The team is pleased to announce the immediate availability of Passbolt version 3. As you may have noticed with the earlier 
release in January and automatic rollout of the v3 webextension, this version contains a major redesign of the login 
and setup screens. The goal of this redesign was to simplify the process and improve the usability. This version 
also concludes our migration to React technology on the front end side, you can learn more about it in the 
[dedicated blog](https://www.medium.com/passbolt) post.

Most notably, this release also introduces the concept of resource types. We will write more about it in a dedicated 
blog post, but long story short, the goal of this change is to allow storing different types of secrets, other than a password. 
The first example of a new resource type is the “password with encrypted description” which has now become the default. This change is transparent 
and backward compatible.

    url="/assets/img/help/2021/02/LU_encrypted_description.png"
    legend="Encrypted description is now on by default on create resource dialog."

As you may know, data in passbolt is divided into two parts: the searchable non encrypted metadata called “resource”, 
and the encrypted part containing, for example the password called “secret”. With resource types the solution will 
support the encapsulation of structured data in the “secret” part in the form of a JSON object, following a JSON schema 
defined as part of the resource type. In the future we want to allow administrators to be able to define their own 
resource types, on top of the ones that are supported by default. In the meantime if you have suggestions for new 
default resource types, and the formats you would like to see (for instance credit cards, ssh keys, etc...), please share your ideas on the 
[community forum](https://community.passbolt.com).

We encountered some issues during the release of the webextension v3, which have been summarized on this dedicated 
[incident page](https://www.passbolt.com/incidents). The most prominent bugs encountered in the last release were
related to older installations where some database entries became incompatible with the new stricter validation rules on 
the front-end side. These issues have now been resolved, but we sincerely apologize for any inconvenience caused, and have learnt a lot during the process.

Server side Passbolt API v3 is also a major release with the deprecation of PHP v7.2 and composer v1. Please make sure you have 
the right dependencies installed on your server prior to upgrade. You can learn more about the update/upgrade procedures 
on the [dedicated page](https://help.passbolt.com/hosting).
Feel free to report bugs on [github](https://www.github.com/passbolt) if you encounter any new issues, or to get in 
touch using the regular support channels.

On the artifacts side, we have published an [ubuntu package](https://help.passbolt.com/hosting/install) and also all of our artifacts (vm, digital ocean, aws ami and docker image)
are using debian package. Using debian package introduces new changes on the installation paths of passbolt. Please read the following
documents for deprecation notices and changes:

* [Release notes](https://github.com/passbolt/passbolt_docker/releases) for docker image.
* [Migrate](https://help.passbolt.com/hosting/upgrade) from ubuntu installation scripts to Ubuntu package.

For our next release(s) the team will focus on an upgrade to Cakephp v4, as well as small UX/UI improvements that 
have been pending for a very long time, including the ability to translate the interface. And yes we also are 
actively working on the Mobile apps, as well as other much demanded features such as Escrow.
