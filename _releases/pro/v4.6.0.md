The Passbolt Pro 4.6.0 release "Purple Haze", brings a new SSO provider and improves administrative aspects and overall system health.

A major addition in this release is the Beta implementation of SSO AD FS (Active Directory Federation Services), enabling streamlined single sign-on capabilities for improved user access management.

Furthermore, this version incorporates the Health Check feature within the Admin workspace, offering administrators a comprehensive tool for system health assessment, thereby enhancing the platform's maintainability and reliability.

Security measures have been bolstered through the update of phpseclib/phpseclib to mitigate known vulnerabilities, alongside improvements in error logging and SSO authentication configurations.

This release also focuses on refining the platform's infrastructure for enhanced performance. It lays the groundwork for future updates by optimizing data verification processes and reducing memory usage during web activities.

The update paves the way for a series of successive enhancements with the next releases.
