Passbolt is pleased to announce the immediate availability of version 4.6.1. This is a maintenance update that contains an important fix for the API, addressing the issue reported by the community since version 4.6.0.

Most notably this update fixes a problem when an administrator is not able to re-enable a suspended user.

We would like to express our sincere thanks to the community members who brought issues to our attention and helped the team to make passbolt better.
