The API allows you to create, update, delete, and share folders.

Folders can be either shared or personal. Whether they are personal or shared depends on their permissions.
One folder (or resource) can only be in one folder for a given user perspective. However, a folder can be in 
multiple parent folder if you look at all users as a whole. This is to allow users to re-organize folders 
shared with them in a way that makes sense to them.

A given folder visibility in the tree is therefore dependent on multiple factors, including if the parent 
folder is also shared.

You can learn more about the folder dynamics in this 
[dedicated blog post](https://medium.com/passbolt/introducing-the-new-folders-feature-77366ae59315).

    <tr>
        <td>modified_by</td>
        <td>String</td>
        <td>UUID of the user who modified the folder</td>
        <td>UUID</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>folder_parent_id</td>
        <td>String</td>
        <td>UUID of the folder contains this folder.</td>
        <td>UUID or null if at the root</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>personal</td>
        <td>Boolean</td>
        <td>Whether the folder has been shared with someone.</td>
        <td>true/false</td>
    </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

## The Resource object

On top of that, when the folder plugin is enabled the resource object also get decorated with 
an extra `folder_parent_id` field. Similarly there is `move` endpoint added for resources.

<table class="table-parameters">
    <thead>
    <tr>
        <th>Attribute</th>
        <th>Type</th>
        <th>Description</th>
        <th>Format</th>
    </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
    <tr>
        <td>folder_parent_id</td>
        <td>String</td>
        <td>UUID of the folder contains this folder.</td>
        <td>UUID or null if at the root</td>
    </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>
