"category": "api,authentication",
"content": "Instead of a conventional form based login system, passbolt uses the GpgAuth protocol for authenticating its clients. It is a challenge based authentication similar to what you would find in protocol such as SSH. You can read more about the authentication process and how it differs from traditional authentication method here.For a practical example, you can also have a look at our simple implementation example written in PHPSequence diagramThe process works by the two-way exchange of encrypted and signed tokens between the user and the service.The authentication process is as follow:        fig. Sequence diagram of a GPGAuth based authenticationCustom response headersThe server uses a set of custom HTTP headers to send information to the client related to the authentication.            Header      Description             X-GPGAuth-Verify-Response       The challenge response, e.g. the secret the server needed to decrypt. The client compares it with the one     stored locally and confirms server’s identity.          X-GPGAuth-Progress   The current login stage number. Possible values are verify, stage0, stage1, complete and logout.          X-GPGAuth-User-Auth-Token   An encrypted token sent from the server for the client to decrypt and hence confirm it’s identity.          X-GPGAuth-Refer   URI of the last location which triggered the login process. Used to redirect back after a successful login.          X-GPGAuth-Error   Any information with regards to an authentication error          X-GPGAuth-Pubkey   The server public key url          X-GPGAuth-Logout-Url   The logout URL          X-GPGAuth-Version   GPGAuth version       Verify StepThe verify step is used the verify your passbolt server identity. It is useful in some security cases such aswhen a domain name is seized. This server identity verification should not be understood as an end to end server authentication, e.g. it does not protect against an attacker performing a man in the middle attack.It is recommended, but optional, for a client to verify the server key. It involves:  The client generates an encrypted token of random data (encrypted with the server public key), and stores  the unencrypted version locally.  That encrypted token is sent to the server along with the user key fingerprint.  Based on the user key fingerprint the server check if the user exist and is active.  If it is the case the server decrypts the nonce and check if it is in the valid format.  The server sends back the decrypted nonce.  The client check if the nonce match the previously recorded one. If it does not match the client warns the user that the server identity cannot be verified.In practice you must:  Create a cryptographically secure random token and store it locally. Encrypt it for the server using the broadcasted public key.  Make a POST request to /auth/verify.json and send the token in request body under gpg_auth[‘server_verify_token’]    'data' =&gt; [  'gpg_auth' =&gt; [      'keyid' =&gt; &lt;fingerprint_of_the_user&gt;,      'server_verify_token' =&gt; &lt;Encrypted_token&gt;  ]]        In the response look for the X-GPGAuth-Verify-Response header and check if it’s value matches with the locally   stored value in step 1.  Proceed to the login step only if they match.Login Steps  The user sends their key fingerprint.  The server checks to see if the fingerprint and user associated with are valid. It then generates an encrypted token of random data, and stores the unencrypted version locally.  The server sends the unencrypted signed user token, and the encrypted server token to the user.  The user enter their private key passphrase, the client decrypt the nonce and check the token format.  The client send back the decrypted nonce along with the user key fingerprint.  The server compares the un-encrypted signed token sent from the client to make sure it matches. If the server is satisfied, the authentication is completed as with a normal form based login: session is started.Step 1To get your GPG key fingerprint, you can use gpg --fingerprint command. It will output a list of fingerprint the current user has access to.$ gpg --fingerprint﻿/home/ada/.gnupg/pubring.kbx-----------------------------pub   rsa4096 2015-10-26 [SC] [expires: 2019-10-26]      03F6 0E95 8F4C B297 23AC  DF76 1353 B5B1 5D9B 054Fuid           [ unknown] Ada Lovelace &lt;ada@passbolt.com&gt;sub   rsa4096 2015-10-26 [E] [expires: 2019-10-26]The client sends the fingerprint of the user’s key via a POST request.POST /auth/login.json'data' =&gt; [    'gpg_auth' =&gt; [        'keyid' =&gt; &lt;fingerprint_of_the_user&gt;    ]]Step 2Step 2a: A matching key is found. The server then generates a random token, stores it locally and then encrypts it with the user’s public key found in the previous step.Step 2b: A matching key is not found. The server returns a HTTP 404 NOT FOUND response meaning the user with the given fingerprint does not access to your passbolt server.Step 3The encrypted token is then sent in the X-GPGAuth-User-Auth-Token header to the client. An example response looks like this.X-GPGAuth-Authenticated: falseX-GPGAuth-Login-URL: /auth/loginX-GPGAuth-Logout-URL: /auth/logoutX-GPGAuth-Progress: stage1X-GPGAuth-Pubkey-URL: /auth/verify.jsonX-GPGAuth-User-Auth-Token: -----BEGIN\\+PGP\\+MESSAGE-----X-GPGAuth-Verify-URL: /auth/verifyX-GPGAuth-Version: 1.3.0        For readability the usual response headers like Cache-Control, Content-Type, Date, Expires etc. are omitted above.        Step 4The token is returned encoded as a url. To be used, it first needs to be decoded. If you have php installed, you can use this command:echo \"&lt;token&gt;\" | php -r \"echo stripslashes(urldecode(file_get_contents('php://stdin')));\" The client then decrypts the encrypted token:echo \"&lt;encrypted_token_from_server&gt;\" | gpg -dThe client must verify the token format. Otherwise there is a risk than an attacker uses this channel to decrypt othercontent. The token format must look like:gpgauthv1.3.0|36|10e2074b-f610-42be-8525-100d4e68c481|gpgauthv1.3.0Hence verifying the ownership of the fingerprint sent in step 1. The passphrase will be required to decrypt the token.After decrypting, the client will send the decrypted (plaintext) data back to the server for verification.POST /auth/login.json'data' =&gt; [    'gpg_auth' =&gt; [        'keyid' =&gt; &lt;same_fingerprint_as_step1&gt;,        'user_token_result' =&gt; &lt;decrypted_token_in_plaintext&gt;     ]]Step 5Finally the server verifies the plaintext token against the one stored locally in step 2 and upon success.  Initiates a session  Logs the user in  Generates a secure token and sends to the client as a cookie called “csrfToken”Working with CSRF tokenTo prevent Cross Site Request Forgery or CSRF attacks a CSRF token must be included in all future requests that affects the integrity of the data (e.g. a resource edit or a user delete action for example). This makes sure that an attaquer can not create a malicious website that would trigger an action in passbolt, e.g prevent “clickjacking”.You can access this CSRF when accessing any read endpoint using the cookie csrfToken. In addition to request data parameters, CSRF tokens can be submitted through a special X-CSRF-Token header. Using a header often makes it easier to integrate a CSRF token with applications consuming the API.Working with MFAPassbolt Pro Edition currently supports logging in using multi factor authentication (MFA). Your script will need to cater for these scenarios, if the account you are using has MFA enabled. After login or when the current MFA authorisation session expires, if MFA is required the current request will be redirected using the HTTP 403 FORBIDDENcode.{  \"header\": {    \"id\": \"b90fc548-236c-4e69-a6f6-27137e3acd0f\",    \"status\": \"error\",    \"servertime\": 1555513784,    \"action\": \"af9aa2c6-7355-514d-a4a0-3e74de4c0fdb\",    \"message\": \"MFA authentication is required.\",    \"url\": \"/mfa/verify/error.json\",    \"code\": 403  },  \"body\": {    \"providers\": {      \"totp\": \"https://my.passbolt.io/mfa/verify/totp.json\"    }  }}The response list the available options. It is possible to redirect the user there or for some providers, such asTOTP (Google Authenticator) or HOTP (Yubikey) to implement this logic directly inside your application the additional interactions.For example you can post the MFA credentials for TOTP provider as follow:fetch('/mfa/verify/totp.json?api-version=v2', {  method: 'POST',  headers: {    'Content-Type': 'application/json; charset=utf-8',    'X-CSRF-Token': crsfToken  },  body: {'totp': otp}});For some other providers like Duo you will require the ability to embed an iframe, which depending on your context may not be possible.",

"title": "Passbolt API Documentation",
"category": "api",
"content": "IntroductionThis document describes passbolt server component API. The API works over HTTPS in a REST fashion, so it islanguage framework agnostic. You can integrate passbolt services into your existing workflow using the toolset of your choice.Getting StartedTo get started with the passbolt REST API (hence referred to as “APIs”) you need at least:  A running passbolt server instance.  A passbolt user account if you want to access protected data.  Some basic understanding of how public key cryptography works.  An OpenPGP-compliant library to build with.Base URLThe API is served over HTTPS. All URLs referenced in the documentation omit the base url of your passbolt installation domain such as: https://&lt;passbolt.your-organization.com&gt;.Response formatResponse envelopePassbolt API return data in an envelope with “header” and “body” properties. The “header” contains response metadata like response code, server_time, error messages etc.The “body” contains the actual payload.So for example requesting a single resource by id will result in something like:``        Notice: The title under header in deprecated and will be removed in future release.    Similarly the code is only indicated to ease readibility for administrator when debugging and should     not be relied on.        Error responsesAn unsuccessful operation will result in an error response. The error response will follow the same scheme as above with the presence of both “header” and “body” properties. Only this time the status in the header will be set to error instead of success. The response body will contain the error details.{    \"header\": {        \"id\": \"965c9f17-18ae-48fd-a36e-e42f04a30442\",        \"status\": \"error\",        \"servertime\": 1554907648,        \"title\": \"app_resources_add_error\",        \"action\": \"ad8bbc35-6435-538e-b1a7-80b87bcedb6a\",        \"message\": \"Could not validate resource data.\",        \"url\": \"\\/resources.json?api-version=v2\",        \"code\": 400    },    \"body\": {        \"name\": {            \"_required\": \"A name is required.\"        },        \"secrets\": {            \"_required\": \"A secret is required.\"        }    }}As you can see, for validation errors, the response body contains two keys, “name” and “secrets” as they failed some validation rules. Further, they also have their own json object with a key (_required) that represents the validation rule that failed and a value (“A name is required”) the actual error message.API VersionsPassbolt API is versioned. Historically passbolt supports two different formats for interacting with the API. At the moment the server component currently supports format version 2 and 1, where v1 is the default (even for v2 server component) for backward compatibility reasons. However this behavior will change in the future so please use (or switch) to API version 2 as soon as possible to minimize refactoring in your application down the road.You can target a specific API version by including a query string api-version in your requests.For example to get a list of all resources using version 1, you can doGET /resources.json?api-version=v1{    \"header\": {        \"id\": \"b8ab8696-e5a1-4a06-bfbc-a7b77efd8f10\",        \"status\": \"success\",        \"servertime\": 1554897334,        \"title\": \"app_resources_index_success\",        \"action\": \"c506210f-7866-5691-8fc1-58772e8f49f1\",        \"message\": \"The operation was successful.\",        \"url\": \"\\/resources.json?api-version=v1\",        \"code\": 200    },    \"body\": [        {            \"Resource\": {                \"id\": \"8e3874ae-4b40-590b-968a-418f704b9d9a\",                \"name\": \"apache\",                \"username\": \"www-data\",                \"uri\": \"http:\\/\\/www.apache.org\\/\",                \"description\": \"Apache is the world\\u0027s most used web server software.\",                \"deleted\": false,                \"created\": \"2019-04-02 12:05:58\",                \"modified\": \"2019-04-03 12:05:58\",                \"created_by\": \"f848277c-5398-58f8-a82a-72397af2d450\",                \"modified_by\": \"f848277c-5398-58f8-a82a-72397af2d450\"            }        },        {            \"Resource\": {                \"id\": \"09c790c0-c003-53c8-a640-25d33cfebc22\",                \"name\": \"bower\",                \"username\": \"bower\",                \"uri\": \"bower.io\",                \"description\": \"A package manager for the web!\",                \"deleted\": false,                \"created\": \"2017-04-04 12:05:58\",                \"modified\": \"2018-04-04 12:05:58\",                \"created_by\": \"640ebc06-5ec1-5322-a1ae-6120ed2f3a74\",                \"modified_by\": \"640ebc06-5ec1-5322-a1ae-6120ed2f3a74\"            }        }    ]}Notice how the associated objects like “Modifier”, “Creator” and “Tag” are on the same level as “Resource”.Whereas the same request using v2 option will be structured differently:GET /resources.json?api-version=v2{    \"header\": {        \"id\": \"58e1d35d-d6cb-4cb7-94b9-f43bae176bfa\",        \"status\": \"success\",        \"servertime\": 1554897573,        \"title\": \"app_resources_index_success\",        \"action\": \"c506210f-7866-5691-8fc1-58772e8f49f1\",        \"message\": \"The operation was successful.\",        \"url\": \"\\/resources.json?api-version=v2\",        \"code\": 200    },    \"body\": [        {            \"id\": \"8e3874ae-4b40-590b-968a-418f704b9d9a\",            \"name\": \"apache\",            \"username\": \"www-data\",            \"uri\": \"http:\\/\\/www.apache.org\\/\",            \"description\": \"Apache is the world\\u0027s most used web server software.\",            \"deleted\": false,            \"created\": \"2019-04-02T12:05:58+00:00\",            \"modified\": \"2019-04-03T12:05:58+00:00\",            \"created_by\": \"f848277c-5398-58f8-a82a-72397af2d450\",            \"modified_by\": \"f848277c-5398-58f8-a82a-72397af2d450\"        },        {            \"id\": \"09c790c0-c003-53c8-a640-25d33cfebc22\",            \"name\": \"bower\",            \"username\": \"bower\",            \"uri\": \"bower.io\",            \"description\": \"A package manager for the web!\",            \"deleted\": false,            \"created\": \"2017-04-04T12:05:58+00:00\",            \"modified\": \"2018-04-04T12:05:58+00:00\",            \"created_by\": \"640ebc06-5ec1-5322-a1ae-6120ed2f3a74\",            \"modified_by\": \"640ebc06-5ec1-5322-a1ae-6120ed2f3a74\"        }    ]}This time the associated fields like “modifier”, “creator” and “tags” are all part of the single “Resource” object they belong to and the object type is not specified anymore. This is just one of the major changes over v1. You can see the complete changelog on the officialthe repository.Encryption and decryptionSecurity and privacy are the biggest concerns for a password manager and passbolt is no exception. The solution uses end-to-end encryption, the encryption and decryption is always done on the client. The serveris mainly used to take care of relational data integrity and storage.Passbolt uses public key cryptography and OpenPGP specifically. This guide assume you are familiar with these concepts.        fig. password exchange using passboltWhich OpenPGP implementation should I use?There are several way you can use OpenPGP. The most popular option is to use GnuPG (directly or via GpgMe) or another implementation in your favorite language.There are various language libraries available such as:  OpenPGP.js: JavaScript alone (used by passbolt extension / cli)  Php Gnupg: PHP with GnuPG (used by passbolt server)  Openpgp-php: PHP alone (used by passbolt server).  gpgme.js: JavaScript with GnuPG  Gpgme Python: Python with GnuPG.  PGPpy: Python alone.You can find the whole list on openpgp.org.Working with OpenPGP KeysAt the time of installation, the passbolt server administrator generates an OpenPGP key pair and stores it in the server keyring. Similarly, clients (such as the passbolt browser extension) generate a pair of keys during the setup. At the end of the setup the client stores its secret key locally and send the public key to the server.When authenticated, it is possible for a user to gather other users public keys, in order to share passwords with them. Prior to sending sensitive data, secrets must be encrypted using the recipient (e.g. another user for example) public key and signed using sender’s.This serves two purposes:  Privacy by encrypting the data and  Authenticity by confirming the identity of the sender.Accessing passbolt server public keyPassbolt server public key is required during the “verify” step of the authentication. This step allows the client to verify the server identity, for example to prevent the unlikely scenario where the domain was seized. Your passbolt server broadcasts its public key at /auth/verify.jsonGET /auth/verify.json{    \"header\": {        \"id\": \"6f416b88-8062-4e94-ab00-259a4cd2e085\",        \"status\": \"success\",        \"servertime\": 1554898043,        \"action\": \"748dcd10-7d15-5498-9aa6-d26de348ff02\",        \"message\": \"The operation was successful.\",        \"url\": \"\\/auth\\/verify.json?api-version=v2\",        \"code\": 200    },    \"body\": {        \"fingerprint\": \"2FC8945833C51946E937F9FED47B0811573EE67E\",        \"keydata\": \"-----BEGIN PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----\"    }}",

Sharing a ResourceSharing a Resource involves the following steps.  Get the id of the Resource you want to share.  Get the id of the ARO you want to share it with.  Encrypt the plaintext secret for all users using their public keys.  Send the ASCII armored encrypted message for each of the affected users to the API.The payload takes a json object with keys for “permissions” and “secrets”. The “permission” key contains a json array where each object represents a Permission object for a user. While the “secrets” key contains a json array where each object represents a Secret object. At the very least, it contains the user_id and OpenPGP encrypted armored message.To generate the encrypted message, you can use$ echo &lt;plaintext_password&gt; | gpg -r &lt;gpg_uid&gt; -e -aThe search-aros endpoint described above outputs the gpg details for individual users like their armored_key, uid, key_id and fingerprint. For Groups, you can make a GET request to /groups/&lt;group_id&gt;.json endpoint. For more info, check the View a group page.

This way you can see if the params pass the validation checks. To simulate sharing a resource you can make a POST request to /share/simulate/resource/&lt;resourceId&gt;.json where resourceId is the id of the Resource you wish to share.POST /share/simulate/resource/&lt;resourceId&gt;.json?api-version=v2If the resource can be shared safely, this returns an associative array that contains a list of new users who will have access to the resource and a list of users who will lose their access. These lists can be used to encrypt the secrets for the users who get access and to remove the secrets of the users who lost their access.{    \"header\": {        \"id\": \"499657b1-463c-49e3-99d0-7d4bca7392c2\",        \"status\": \"success\",        \"servertime\": 1554972001,        \"title\": \"app_share_dryRun_success\",        \"action\": \"7df37cb5-cfb9-57c2-a7a5-b65c9f573de0\",        \"message\": \"The operation was successful.\",        \"url\": \"\\/share\\/simulate\\/resource\\/8e3874ae-4b40-590b-968a-418f704b9d9a.json?api-version=v2\",        \"code\": 200    },    \"body\": {        \"changes\": {            \"added\": [\"&lt;uuid1&gt;\", \"&lt;uuid2&gt;\"],            \"removed\": [\"&lt;uuid3&gt;\", \"&lt;uuid4&gt;\"]        }    }}Final sharingIf the simulation returns a success response, you can go ahead with sharing your resource.

To retrieve the plaintext password, you must decrypt it using the associated secret key.{% include messages/notice.html    content=\"The plaintext password is encrypted using the user's public key it's shared with. So to decrypt it, you must have secret/private key of that user in your keyring.\"%}In the example above, the string under the key `data` is the encrypted plaintext password. To decrypt it to retrieve the plaintext password, you can use `gpg -d` or `gpg --decrypt` command. Here is an example```bash$ echo \"\" | gpg -d```It should output the plaintext password on the console.```bash$ echo \"\" | gpg -dgpg: encrypted with 4096-bit RSA key, ID 7A8E6D66F5DC4C49, created 2019-03-13      \"Abhinav Kumar \"hello  ``` In the example above \"hello\" is the plaintext password.",

For example, your username, the comments or the list of people you are sharing a password with are not encrypted using OpenPGP, and are stored in plaintext both on the client and server side. Obviously passwords can be available in decrypted form at some point (the later the better), but they will never be stored in plain text on the filesystem on either the client or server side.For the data in motion, e.g. on the transport layer level, all the communication are encrypted using SSL. The strength of the security at that level is not controlled by the passbolt solution itself but rather a combination of other factors such as the level of security of the organization issuing the certificate and the operating system configuration chosen by the hosting provider.For the data at rest, for most of the clients and servers, it is also possible to encrypt the database at the file system level as well.

On the client side passbolt uses OpenPGP.js as a foundation for all its cryptographic functionalities.On the server side passbolt uses both the GnuPG Php Extension and openpgp-php in order to perform public key validation and to support the GPGAuth authentication protocol. By default the solution uses SSL to encrypt all communication between the server and the browser.",

Currently, the recommendation to solve these problems is to use a browser extension. Passbolt follows this recommendation.The other issue has to do with the quality of the javascript implementation of the cryptographic functionalities and the fact that JavaScript has its fair share of pitfalls. This is true for any programming languages and can only be addressed through careful code review. Passbolt uses OpenPGP.js for its cryptographic functionalities which have been reviewed multiple times by Cure53.Organizing more regular independent 3rd party audits is one of our main priorities.

When the source code is freely available, anyone can organize a review and check if the level of security the product provides is adequate.Some people may argue that an attacker could find vulnerabilities more easily if the code is available to everyone.While it is true, but the corollary is also true, e.g. people without malicious intent too can find these vulnerabilities and fix them, making the solution stronger in the long term.

You can use the followingcommand to send a test email and get more debug information:$ ./bin/cake passbolt send_test_email --recipient=youremail@domain.comIf this fails you should double check what is the recommended configuration in your email provider documentation.You can also ask on the community forum in case another user have a working configuration for the same provider.Reason 2: Email notifications are disabled in the configAnother reason could be because email notifications are disabled in you configuration.You can review such settings in the administration panel, when you are logged in as an administrator in passbolt.        fig. Email Notification Settings - Email DeliveryDepending on the configuration method you have used to setup, you may need to check for configuration in config/passbolt.php or with environment variables you are loading (if you use docker containers for example).Reason 3: The cron job to send email is missingPassbolt uses a system of email queue to send email notifications.In practice this means there is a dedicated job that runs to go through the queue and sendemails at the interval of your choice.So if you manage to send the test email but are not receiving notifications (such as registration emails),one of the reason may be that the cron job required to send the emails is missing. Depending on the method you used to install, it may have not be set, or failed to set.In order to find out you should check if you have the following cron for the web server user (www-data on Debian/Ubuntu, nginx on Centos), running where you passbolt was installed (/var/www/passbolt by default).$ crontab -u www-data -e* * * * * /var/www/passbolt/bin/cake EmailQueue.sender &gt;&gt; /var/log/passbolt.logIf the cron is present, you should check if there are more data in the /var/log/passbolt.log log file, it may give you more information about the issue.Reason 4: The webserver user is not allowed to run cron jobsOn some system, like RHEL or Centos, thenginx user may not have the right to run the cron job to send emails,because of your PAM configuration. In this case you may want to add nginx to the PAM config to have cron and crond:local permissions.Reason 5: There is an issue with the database schema related to the email queueIf after an update you are getting error messages such as:Exception: SQLSTATE[42S22]: Column not found: 1054 Unknown column ‘EmailQueue.to’ in ‘field list’ ...It is possible that the wrong version of the data model is stored in the cache.

"content": "Important: The Ldap plugin is part of Passbolt Pro only and is not available in the Community Edition. Introduction What is it? The goal of the directory synchronization tool, also called LDAP connector, is to provide a way for a passboltadministrator to synchronize a list of groups and users, as well as the associated group memberships. Currently the connector supports two types of directory: OpenLDAP and Microsoft Active Directory. In the futurewe will also support other non ldap based user directories such as Google API User Directory. How does it work? In a nutshell this part of the application will try to keep passbolt and a directory in sync with a minimalinvolvement of the administrators and group managers. However if an action is not possible, such as, deletinga user that is the sole password owner, the process triggers will trigger relevant email notifications sothat a human can solve it manually....",
