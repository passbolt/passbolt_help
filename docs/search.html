In short the server generate a challenge thatmust be decrypted and returned by the user. It also contains a challenge to verify the user server key.Challenge based authentication is different that form based authentication, you can learn more about the differenceon this page.Sequence diagramThe authentication process works by the two-way exchange of encrypted and signed tokens(nonces) between the user andthe server. The authentication process is as follows:        fig. Sequence diagram of a GPGAuth-based authenticationCustom response headersThe server uses a set of custom HTTP headers to send information to the client related to the authentication.It will be easier to understand their use in the steps that follow, but a brief description of some of them isprovided here:            Header      Description             X-GPGAuth-Verify-Response       The challenge response, e.g. the secret the server needed to decrypt. The client compares it with the one    stored locally and confirms server‚Äôs identity.          X-GPGAuth-Progress   The current login stage number. Possible values are verify, stage0, stage1, complete and logout.          X-GPGAuth-User-Auth-Token   An encrypted token sent from the server for the client to decrypt in order to confirm its identity.          X-GPGAuth-Refer   URI of the last location which triggered the login process. Used to redirect back after a successful login.          X-GPGAuth-Error   Any information with regards to an authentication error          X-GPGAuth-Pubkey   The server public key url          X-GPGAuth-Logout-Url   The logout URL          X-GPGAuth-Version   GPGAuth version       Authentication sequence detailsVerify StepThe verify step is used to verify your passbolt server identity. It is useful in some security cases such aswhen a domain name is seized. This server identity verification should not be understood as an end-to-end serverauthentication, e.g. it does not protect against an attacker performing a man in the middle attack.Though this step is optional, it is recommended for a client to verify the server key. It involves:  The client generates a token(nonce) in a specific format. It must have the pattern of version, UUID length,v4 UUID, and version (separated with pipes):    gpgauthv1.3.0|36|10e2074b-f610-42be-8525-100d4e68c481|gpgauthv1.3.0        The client then encrypts the token with the server‚Äôs broadcasted public keyand stores the unencrypted version of the token locally, for future use.    The encrypted token is sent to the server along with the user key fingerprint.Make a POST request to /auth/verify.json and send the token in the request body under gpg_auth[‚Äòserver_verify_token‚Äô]:    'data' =&gt; [ 'gpg_auth' =&gt; [     'keyid' =&gt; &lt;fingerprint_of_the_user&gt;,     'server_verify_token' =&gt; &lt;Encrypted_token&gt; ]]        Based on the user key fingerprint the server checks if the user exists and is active. If the fingerprint is verified, the server decrypts the token and checks if it is in the valid format.  If in a valid format, the server sends back the decrypted token: in the response look for the X-GPGAuth-Verify-Response header.  The client checks if the token matches the unencrypted one stored locally. If it does not match the client warns the user that the server identity cannot be verified.  The client proceeds to the login step only if the local unencrypted token matches the server‚Äôs decrypted token.Login StepSteps Overview  The client sends the user key fingerprint to the server.  The server checks to see if the fingerprint is valid and if the user associated with it is active. It then generates a token of random data, stores an unencrypted version locally, and then creates an encrypted version of the token as well.  The server sends the encrypted token to the client.  The client prompts the user to enter their private key passphrase, the client decrypts the encrypted server token and checks the token format.  The client sends back the decrypted token along with the user key fingerprint again.  The server compares the decrypted token sent from the client to make sure it matches its locally stored unencrypted token from step 2. If the server is satisfied, the authentication is completed as with a normal form-based login: a session is started.Step 1 detailTo get your GPG key fingerprint, you can use the gpg --fingerprint command. It will output a list of fingerprint thecurrent user has access to.$ gpg --fingerprintÔªø/home/ada/.gnupg/pubring.kbx-----------------------------pub   rsa4096 2015-10-26 [SC] [expires: 2019-10-26]      03F6¬†0E95¬†8F4C¬†B297¬†23AC¬†¬†DF76¬†1353¬†B5B1¬†5D9B¬†054Fuid           [ unknown] Ada Lovelace &lt;ada@passbolt.com&gt;sub   rsa4096 2015-10-26 [E] [expires: 2019-10-26]It is also possible to retrieve your fingerprint via the passbolt app. Once logged in, navigate to your user‚Äôs Profile, and selectKeys Inspector (URL path: /app/settings/keys).The client sends the fingerprint of the user‚Äôs key via a POST request.POST /auth/login.json'data' =&gt; [    'gpg_auth' =&gt; [        'keyid' =&gt; &lt;fingerprint_of_the_user&gt;    ]]Step 2 detailStep 2a: A matching key is found on the server, and the user is active. The server then generates a random token,stores it locally and then encrypts it with the user‚Äôs public key.Step 2b: A matching key is not found, or one is found but it belongs to an inactive user. The server returns aHTTP 404 NOT FOUND  response meaning the user with the given fingerprint is not granted access to your passbolt server.Step 3 detailThe encrypted token is then sent in theX-GPGAuth-User-Auth-Token header to the client. An example response looks like this.X-GPGAuth-Authenticated: falseX-GPGAuth-Login-URL: /auth/loginX-GPGAuth-Logout-URL: /auth/logoutX-GPGAuth-Progress: stage1X-GPGAuth-Pubkey-URL: /auth/verify.jsonX-GPGAuth-User-Auth-Token: -----BEGIN\\+PGP\\+MESSAGE-----X-GPGAuth-Verify-URL: /auth/verifyX-GPGAuth-Version: 1.3.0        For readability the usual response headers like Cache-Control, Content-Type, Date, Expires etc. are omitted above.        Step 4 detailThe client asks the user the private key passphrase. Then with the private key, the client decrypts the token given by the server and verifies its format.Step 5 detailThe token is returned encoded as a url. To be used, it first needs to be decoded.Decode token with PHPIf you have php installed, you can use this command:echo \"&lt;token&gt;\" | php -r \"echo stripslashes(urldecode(file_get_contents('php://stdin')));\"Decode token using a browser consoleAlternatively, you could use the console of your browser with Javascript to decode the key:var uri = \"-----BEGIN\\+PGP\\+MESSAGE----- ...\"decodeURIComponent(uri)Using this browser console approach will still leave plus(+) signs in the header and footer which must be replacedwith spaces.Decrypt tokenNow that the token has been decoded, the client then decrypts the encrypted token:echo \"&lt;encrypted_token_from_server&gt;\" | gpg -dThe user‚Äôs private key passphrase will be required for decryption while also serving to verify the ownership of thefingerprint sent in step 1.The client must verify the token for proper format. Otherwise, there is a risk than an attacker uses this channel todecrypt othercontent. The token format must look like:gpgauthv1.3.0|36|10e2074b-f610-42be-8525-100d4e68c481|gpgauthv1.3.0After decrypting, the client will send the decrypted (plaintext) data back to the server for verification.POST /auth/login.json'data' =&gt; [    'gpg_auth' =&gt; [        'keyid' =&gt; &lt;same_fingerprint_as_step1&gt;,        'user_token_result' =&gt; &lt;decrypted_token_in_plaintext&gt;    ]]Step 6 detailFinally, the server verifies the plaintext token against the one stored locally in step 2 and upon success:  Initiates a session  Logs the user in  Generates a secure token and sends to the client as a cookie called ‚ÄúcsrfToken‚ÄùWorking with CSRF tokenTo prevent Cross Site Request Forgery (‚ÄúCSRF attacks‚Äù) aCSRF token must be included in all future requests that affect the integrity of the data (e.g. a resource edit, auser delete action). This makes sure that an attacker cannot create a malicious website that wouldtrigger an action in passbolt (e.g. preventing ‚Äúclickjacking‚Äù).        Currently the csrfToken cookie is not returned in the same Success response in Step 5 above. A simple GET call    to /users/me.json will allow for the client to receive the cookie. This cookie can then be submitted through a special     X-CSRF-Token header. Using a header often makes it easier to integrate a CSRF token with applications consuming the API.        Working with MFAPassbolt Pro Edition currently supports logging in using multi factor authentication (MFA). Your script will need tocater for these scenarios if the account you are using has MFA enabled. After login, or when the current MFAauthorization session expires, if MFA is required the current request will be redirected using the HTTP 403 FORBIDDENcode.{  \"header\": {    \"id\": \"b90fc548-236c-4e69-a6f6-27137e3acd0f\",    \"status\": \"error\",    \"servertime\": 1555513784,    \"action\": \"af9aa2c6-7355-514d-a4a0-3e74de4c0fdb\",    \"message\": \"MFA authentication is required.\",    \"url\": \"/mfa/verify/error.json\",    \"code\": 403  },  \"body\": {    \"providers\": {      \"totp\": \"https://my.passbolt.io/mfa/verify/totp.json\"    }  }}The response lists the available options. It is possible to redirect the user there or for some providers, such asTOTP (Google Authenticator) or HOTP (Yubikey), to implement this logic directly inside yourapplication with additional interactions.For example you can post the MFA credentials for TOTP provider as follow:fetch('/mfa/verify/totp.json', {  method: 'POST',  headers: {    'Content-Type': 'application/json; charset=utf-8',    'X-CSRF-Token': crsfToken  },  body: {'totp': otp}});For some other providers like Duo, it requires you to have the ability to embed an iframe.",

"content": "To update a Folder permissions, e.g. share a folder, you can make a request with the updated folder permission in request body. The current user must have the ‚Äúowner‚Äù permission on the folder. There must always at least be one owner of the folder, e.g. if the current user give up this right they must appoint another owner.PUT /share/folder/&lt;folderId&gt;.jsonPermissions in passbolt use some Access Control List (ACL) lingo. Mostly two concepts:  Access Control Object (ACO) that represents something that is wanted, like a folder, or a resource.  Access Request Object (ARO) represents something that wants an ACO, so a user or a group.Request dataThe request body expects the following request data            Parameter        Description        Required        Validation Constraints                permissions        The permissions to update        Yes        Array of permission.

The response body will contain the newly updated user object       400   Bad RequestSome of the data validation failed.       403   Authentication FailureThe user making the request is not authenticated  ExamplesSuccessful requestWhen sharing you only need to send the permissions that have changed.

Whether they are personal or shared depends on their permissions.One folder (or resource) can only be in one folder for a given user perspective. However, a folder can be in multiple parent folder if you look at all users as a whole. This is to allow users to re-organize folders shared with them in a way that makes sense to them.A given folder visibility in the tree is therefore dependent on multiple factors, including if the parent folder is also shared.You can learn more about the folder dynamics in this dedicated blog post.The Folder object                Attribute        Type        Description        Format                        id        String        Unique ID of the folder in UUID format.

"title": "Form-based vs. Challenge-Based Authentication",
"category": "api,form-vs-challenge",
"content": "IntroductionInstead of a conventional form-based login system, passbolt uses the GpgAuth protocolfor authenticating its clients. It is a challenge-based authentication similar to what you would find in a protocol such as SSH. Our goals were both to improve the security and usability of the overall solution.Form-based authenticationWhile some web apps today defer to another service such as Google or Facebook to handle the authentication, most still support a form-based authentication by default.The process goes as follows:        fig. Sequence diagram of a form-based authenticationDuring the registration step of a typical web app, the password is sent (ideally over HTTPS) to the server. This password is then salted and hashed using bcrypt (or equivalent) and stored for future use by the server. A salt known only by this application instance is used to prevent brute force cracking of the password in case its hash gets leaked (via a SQL injection, for example).During a subsequent login by the user, the password is sent and in a process similar to the original registration, the server hashes it and compares it with the stored version. If the hashes match then the server stores a session token that is sent back as a cookie (or url parameter) which is also set on the client side. This cookie is then produced by the client for each request for the duration of the session (until the cookie expires, the user logs out, or the server terminates the session).The problem with form-based authenticationThe main issue is one of usability. Using this approach for passbolt would mean that a user would need to remember yet another password on top of their private key passphrase. This goes against the basic benefit of having a password manager.If a login password was required, we would also have to store the password in the authentication plugin. But this would complicate our requirements as it would then mandate the development of additional procedures for a passbolt user‚Äôs account password to be created, updated and recovered.Another inherent dilemma to this approach is the potential inability for the user to reset their password using an email verification, in case the password to their email client is stored in passbolt.There are also other issues not specific to passbolt‚Äôs requirements but still worth trying to fix with an approach other than form-based:  Phishing: it is possible for an attacker to mimic the passbolt login page and trick a user into entering their credentials. Traditional form-based authentication does not perform server identity verification: it is the responsibility of the user to verify if the URL is correct and SSL certificates are valid.  Password quality: password fatigue generally leads to password reuse, poor rotation and weak strength. Although stricter validation can be implemented on the server side to improve password quality, this quality is achieved only by placing an additional burden on the user.",

"title": "Passbolt API Documentation",
"category": "api",
"content": "IntroductionThis document describes passbolt server component API. The API works over HTTPS in a REST fashion, so it islanguage framework agnostic. You can integrate passbolt services into your existing workflow using thetoolset of your choice.Getting StartedTo get started with the passbolt REST API (hereafter referred to as ‚ÄúThe API‚Äù) you need at least:  A running passbolt server instance.  A passbolt user account if you want to access protected data.  Some basic understanding of how public key cryptography works.  An OpenPGP-compliant library to build with.Base URLThe API is served over HTTPS. All URLs referenced in the documentation omit the base urlof your passbolt installation domain such as:https://&lt;passbolt.your-organization.com&gt;.Response formatResponse envelopeThe API returns data in an envelope with ‚Äúheader‚Äù and ‚Äúbody‚Äù properties.The ‚Äúheader‚Äù contains response metadata like response code, server_time, error messages etc.The ‚Äúbody‚Äù contains the actual payload.For example, requesting a single resource by id will result in something like:{    \"header\": {        \"id\": \"799c69c7-1789-4d87-9fbf-02529b0d21dc\",        \"status\": \"success\",        \"servertime\": 1554909967,        \"action\": \"ad71952e-7842-599e-a19e-3a82e6974b23\",        \"message\": \"The operation was successful.\",        \"url\": \"\\/secrets\\/resource\\/8e3874ae-4b40-590b-968a-418f704b9d9a.json\",        \"code\": 200    },    \"body\": {        \"id\": \"eede75ff-316a-511c-8317-51e8339b6dcc\",        \"user_id\": \"f848277c-5398-58f8-a82a-72397af2d450\",        \"resource_id\": \"8e3874ae-4b40-590b-968a-418f704b9d9a\",        \"resource_type_id\": \"e2aa01a9-84ec-55f8-aaed-24ee23259339\",        \"data\": \"-----BEGIN PGP MESSAGE-----\",        \"created\": \"2019-04-04T12:06:50+00:00\",        \"modified\": \"2019-04-04T12:06:50+00:00\"    }}        Notice: The title under header is deprecated and will be removed in future release.    Similarly, the code is only indicated to improve readability for an administrator when debugging and should    not be relied on.        Error responsesAn unsuccessful operation will result in an error response. The error response will follow the same scheme as abovewith the presence of both ‚Äúheader‚Äù and ‚Äúbody‚Äù properties, only this time the status in the header will be set toerror instead of success. The response body will contain the error details.{    \"header\": {        \"id\": \"965c9f17-18ae-48fd-a36e-e42f04a30442\",        \"status\": \"error\",        \"servertime\": 1554907648,        \"action\": \"ad8bbc35-6435-538e-b1a7-80b87bcedb6a\",        \"message\": \"Could not validate resource data.\",        \"url\": \"\\/resources.json\",        \"code\": 400    },    \"body\": {        \"name\": {            \"_required\": \"A name is required.\"        },        \"secrets\": {            \"_required\": \"A secret is required.\"        }    }}As you can see, for validation errors, the response body contains two keys, ‚Äúname‚Äù and ‚Äúsecrets‚Äù as they failedsome validation rules. Further, they also have their own json object with a key (‚Äú_required‚Äù) that represents thevalidation rule that failed and a value with the actual error message (‚ÄúA name is required‚Äù).API VersionsHistorically, passbolt supported two different formats for interacting with the API. API version 1 is now deprecated.The passbolt server component supports only API version 2 and all calls are assumed to be version 2 - no parameter is neededto designate this.You can see the complete changelog on the officialthe repository.Encryption and decryptionSecurity and privacy are the biggest concerns for a password manager and passbolt is no exception.Passbolt‚Äôs solution uses end-to-end encryption and the encryption and decryption is always done on the client. The serveris mainly used to take care of relational data integrity and storage.Passbolt uses public key cryptographyand OpenPGP specifically. This guide will assume you are familiar with these concepts.        fig. password exchange using passboltWhich OpenPGP implementation should I use?There are several ways you can use OpenPGP. The most popular option is to use GnuPG(directly or via GPGME) or another implementation in yourfavorite language.There are various language libraries available such as:  OpenPGP.js: JavaScript alone (used by passbolt extension / cli)  PHP GnuPG: PHP with GnuPG (used by passbolt server)  OpenPGP.php: PHP alone (used by passbolt server).  gpgme.js: JavaScript for GPGME  GPGME Python: Python with GnuPG.  PGPy: Python alone.You can find additional libraries on openpgp.org.Working with OpenPGP KeysAt the time of installation the passbolt server administrator generates an OpenPGP key pair and stores it inthe server keyring. Similarly, clients (such as the passbolt browser extension) generate a pair of keys during the setup.At the end of the setup the client stores its secret key locally and send the public key to the server.When authenticated, it is possible for a user to gather other user‚Äôs public keys, in order to share passwords with them.Prior to sending sensitive data, secrets must be encrypted using the recipient‚Äôs public key (e.g. another user, for example) and signed using the sender‚Äôs public key.This serves two purposes:  Privacy by encrypting the data and  Authenticity by confirming the identity of the sender.Accessing passbolt server public keyThe passbolt server public key is required during the ‚Äúverify‚Äù step of the authentication. This step allows theclient to verify the server identity, for example to prevent the unlikely scenario where the domain was seized.Your passbolt server broadcasts its public key at /auth/verify.json:GET /auth/verify.json{    \"header\": {        \"id\": \"6f416b88-8062-4e94-ab00-259a4cd2e085\",        \"status\": \"success\",        \"servertime\": 1554898043,        \"action\": \"748dcd10-7d15-5498-9aa6-d26de348ff02\",        \"message\": \"The operation was successful.\",        \"url\": \"\\/auth\\/verify.json\",        \"code\": 200    },    \"body\": {        \"fingerprint\": \"2FC8945833C51946E937F9FED47B0811573EE67E\",        \"keydata\": \"-----BEGIN PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----\"    }}",

Access Request Object (ARO) represents something that wants an ACO, so a user or a group.Get all AROsIn order to know the list of AROs with whom a Resource can be shared, you can use the search-aros endpoint.To get the ARO list make a GET request to /share/search-aros.jsonGET /share/search-aros.jsonThe response returned will have an array of json objects, each representing either a Group or a User.{    \"header\": {        \"id\": \"1e0b7ca1-8427-4ec4-a46e-b3dc4f11f878\",        \"status\": \"success\",        \"servertime\": 1554968444,        \"action\": \"10807e9e-d525-5acc-b05d-cccbbd252a93\",        \"message\": \"The operation was successful.\",        \"url\": \"\\/share\\/search-aros.json\",        \"code\": 200    },    \"body\": [        {            \"user_count\": \"18\",            \"id\": \"bda0a05c-b1fa-58be-b5b9-446e65ace052\",            \"name\": \"Group Name\",            \"deleted\": false,            \"created\": \"2018-01-08T13:39:25+00:00\",            \"modified\": \"2018-01-08T13:39:25+00:00\",            \"created_by\": \"d57c10f5-639d-5160-9c81-8a0c6c4ec856\",            \"modified_by\": \"d57c10f5-639d-5160-9c81-8a0c6c4ec856\"        },        {            \"id\": \"f848277c-5398-58f8-a82a-72397af2d450\",            \"role_id\": \"a58de6d3-f52c-5080-b79b-a601a647ac85\",            \"username\": \"ada@passbolt.com\",            \"active\": true,            \"deleted\": false,            \"created\": \"2019-02-04T12:05:44+00:00\",            \"modified\": \"2019-03-04T12:05:44+00:00\",            \"profile\": {}, // User profile object            \"groups_users\": [                {                    \"id\": \"4f2a3f6e-1a3f-4f4a-a523-46c6b6d0f763\",                    \"group_id\": \"05b68bd2-e4e8-4838-ac21-4661b27fb23b\",                    \"user_id\": \"f848277c-5398-58f8-a82a-72397af2d450\",                    \"is_admin\": true,                    \"created\": \"2019-04-08T12:44:44+00:00\"                },                {                    \"id\": \"6809e727-1219-4cfa-a201-1d3e997ca351\",                    \"group_id\": \"73479f22-b387-4d4e-b625-b1cc0b7ed116\",                    \"user_id\": \"f848277c-5398-58f8-a82a-72397af2d450\",                    \"is_admin\": true,                    \"created\": \"2019-04-08T12:10:03+00:00\"                }            ],            \"role\": {                \"id\": \"a58de6d3-f52c-5080-b79b-a601a647ac85\",                \"name\": \"user\",                \"description\": \"Logged in user\",                \"created\": \"2012-07-04T13:39:25+00:00\",                \"modified\": \"2012-07-04T13:39:25+00:00\"            },            \"gpgkey\": {                \"id\": \"04481719-5d9d-5e22-880a-a6b9270601d2\",                \"user_id\": \"f848277c-5398-58f8-a82a-72397af2d450\",                \"armored_key\": \"-----BEGIN PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----\",                \"bits\": 4096,                \"uid\": \"Ada Lovelace \\u003Cada@passbolt.com\\u003E\",                \"key_id\": \"5D9B054F\",                \"fingerprint\": \"03F60E958F4CB29723ACDF761353B5B15D9B054F\",                \"type\": \"RSA\",                \"expires\": \"2019-08-09T12:48:31+00:00\",                \"key_created\": \"2015-08-09T12:48:31+00:00\",                \"deleted\": false,                \"created\": \"2019-04-04T12:05:49+00:00\",                \"modified\": \"2019-04-04T12:05:49+00:00\"            },            \"last_logged_in\": \"\"        }    ]}        Take a note of the user_count key under group type AROs as that‚Äôs the exact number of secrets you‚Äôll need to send in order to share a resource with that group.        Sharing a ResourceSharing a Resource involves the following steps.  Get the id of the Resource you want to share.  Get the id of the ARO you want to share it with.  Encrypt the plaintext secret for all users using their public keys.  Send the ASCII armored encrypted message for each of the affected users to the API.The payload takes a json object with keys for ‚Äúpermissions‚Äù and ‚Äúsecrets‚Äù. The ‚Äúpermission‚Äù key contains a json array where each object represents a Permission object for a user. While the ‚Äúsecrets‚Äù key contains a json array where each object represents a Secret object. At the very least, it contains the user_id and OpenPGP encrypted armored message.To generate the encrypted message, you can use$ echo &lt;plaintext_password&gt; | gpg -r &lt;gpg_uid&gt; -e -aThe search-aros endpoint described above outputs the gpg details for individual users like their armored_key, uid, key_id and fingerprint. For Groups, you can make a GET request to /groups/&lt;group_id&gt;.json endpoint. For more info, check the View a group page.        Based on the trust level of the public key gpg might complain about There is no assurance this key belongs to the named user If you trust the key, you can proceed by responding ‚Äòy‚Äô        Upon confirmation, gpg outputs the ascii armored message$ echo &lt;plaintext_password&gt; | gpg -r &lt;gpg_uid&gt; -e -a-----BEGIN PGP MESSAGE-----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2F87-----END PGP MESSAGE-----This needs to be done for each user gaining access to the secretSo the request body will look like{  \"permissions\": [    {      \"is_new\": true,      \"aro\": \"Group\",      \"aro_foreign_key\": \"36563004-3f25-50c0-b22e-6554c3ccc4e7\",      \"aco\": \"Resource\",      \"aco_foreign_key\": \"8e3874ae-4b40-590b-968a-418f704b9d9a\",      \"type\": 7    }],  \"secrets\": [    {      \"user_id\": \"8d04cf98-716b-5f6d-9fe8-c130f8992646\",      \"data\":\"-----BEGIN PGP MESSAGE-----\"    }  ]}Simulate SharingPassbolt API allows you to simulate a share before actually going through with this. This way you can see if the params pass the validation checks. To simulate sharing a resource you can make a POST request to /share/simulate/resource/&lt;resourceId&gt;.json where resourceId is the id of the Resource you wish to share.POST /share/simulate/resource/&lt;resourceId&gt;.jsonIf the resource can be shared safely, this returns an associative array that contains a list of new users who will have access to the resource and a list of users who will lose their access. These lists can be used to encrypt the secrets for the users who get access and to remove the secrets of the users who lost their access.{    \"header\": {        \"id\": \"499657b1-463c-49e3-99d0-7d4bca7392c2\",        \"status\": \"success\",        \"servertime\": 1554972001,        \"action\": \"7df37cb5-cfb9-57c2-a7a5-b65c9f573de0\",        \"message\": \"The operation was successful.\",        \"url\": \"\\/share\\/simulate\\/resource\\/8e3874ae-4b40-590b-968a-418f704b9d9a.json\",        \"code\": 200    },    \"body\": {        \"changes\": {            \"added\": [\"&lt;uuid1&gt;\", \"&lt;uuid2&gt;\"],            \"removed\": [\"&lt;uuid3&gt;\", \"&lt;uuid4&gt;\"]        }    }}Final sharingIf the simulation returns a success response, you can go ahead with sharing your resource.

To retrieve the plaintext password, you must decrypt it using the associated secret key.{% include messages/notice.html    content=\"The plaintext password is encrypted using the user's public key it's shared with. So to decrypt it, you must have secret/private key of that user in your keyring.\"%}In the example above, the string under the key `data` is the encrypted plaintext password. To decrypt it to retrieve the plaintext password, you can use `gpg -d` or `gpg --decrypt` command. Here is an example```bash$ echo \"\" | gpg -d```It should output the plaintext password on the console.```bash$ echo \"\" | gpg -dgpg: encrypted with 4096-bit RSA key, ID 7A8E6D66F5DC4C49, created 2019-03-13      \"Abhinav Kumar \"hello  ``` In the example above \"hello\" is the plaintext password.",

We recognize that gender-based discrimination, harassment, and prejudice can have a negative impact on individuals and the community as a whole, and we strive to prevent such behavior.Inclusion and DiversityWe value diversity and recognize the importance of having a community that reflects a variety of perspectives and experiences. We are committed to creating an environment that welcomes and embraces individuals of all genders, including those who identify as non-binary, genderqueer, or transgender. We actively encourage the participation of individuals of all genders in our community.Anti-DiscriminationWe do not tolerate discrimination based on gender, gender identity or expression, or any other characteristic protected by applicable law. We will not accept any form of derogatory remarks, images, or exclusion from activities or opportunities.AccommodationsWe strive to create an environment that is accessible and accommodating to all individuals, regardless of gender or gender identity. We will work with individuals to ensure that they have access to the resources and accommodations they need to participate fully in our community.Anti-harassment policyWe pledge to respect everyone who contributes to this project in any way.We welcome contributions from everyone regardless of geographical location, age, culture, ethnicity, gender, gender-identity, language, disability, physical appearance, sexual orientation and religious views.We do not tolerate harassment of participants in any form. Personal attacks, hate speech, trolling, baiting, spamming, any intentional form of discrimination, unwelcome sexual attention or imagery, deliberate intimidation, physical threats, stalking or any other kind of bad behaviour will be dealt with decisively.Offenders will be temporarily or permanently banned from communicating through Passbolt‚Äôs systems and events or otherwise penalised. These rules may be enforced at the discretion of Passbolt staff by removing issues, comments, blocking or reporting accounts and banning from online or public meetings.Interaction principlesWe pledge to adhere to following principles when interacting with each other:Be respectful: there will always be people with whom we may disagree or find it difficult to cooperate. We will, however, take a deep breath if we need to and then remain respectful.Agree to disagree: decisions are often a difficult choice between competing priorities and there are many ways of reaching our common goals. If we disagree, we will do so politely.Assume good faith: when we disagree we do not assume the worst, it is unlikely a participant is intentionally trying to degrade the quality of a discussion or product. We will assume best intentions in our interactions.Welcome other perspectives: we actively seek to be open to ideas that make our own ideas better. We empower others to speak and will strive to make diversity and inclusion intentional. We welcome contributions from everyone as long as they interact constructively with our community.Be concise: we try to be concise and avoid repeating what has already been said. We try to stay on topic, especially in discussions that are already fairly large.Be transparent: we are open about what we are working on to allow others to participate. We are also transparent about our mistakes to allow others tolearn and avoid repeating them.Handling issuesIf you are subject to or witness unacceptable behavior, or have any other concerns, please email us at contact@passbolt.comDate of Last UpdateThis code of conduct was last updated on November 21st, 2017.",

For example, your username, the comments or the list of people you are sharing a password with are not encrypted using OpenPGP, and are stored in plaintext both on the client and server side. Obviously passwords can be available in decrypted form at some point (the later the better), but they will never be stored in plain text on the filesystem on either the client or server side.For the data in motion, e.g. on the transport layer level, all the communication are encrypted using SSL. The strength of the security at that level is not controlled by the passbolt solution itself but rather a combination of other factors such as the level of security of the organization issuing the certificate and the operating system configuration chosen by the hosting provider.For the data at rest, for most of the clients and servers, it is also possible to encrypt the database at the file system level as well.

On the client side passbolt uses OpenPGP.js as a foundation for all its cryptographic functionalities.On the server side passbolt uses both the GnuPG Php Extension and openpgp-php in order to perform public key validation and to support the GPGAuth authentication protocol.

Currently, the recommendation to solve these problems is to use a browser extension. Passbolt follows this recommendation.The other issue has to do with the quality of the javascript implementation of the cryptographic functionalities and the fact that JavaScript has its fair share of pitfalls. This is true for any programming languages and can only be addressed through careful code review. Passbolt uses OpenPGP.js for its cryptographic functionalities which have been reviewed multiple times by Cure53.Organizing more regular independent 3rd party audits is one of our main priorities.

When the source code is freely available, anyone can organize a review and check if the level of security the product provides is adequate.Some people may argue that an attacker could find vulnerabilities more easily if the code is available to everyone.While it is true, but the corollary is also true, e.g. people without malicious intent too can find these vulnerabilities and fix them, making the solution stronger in the long term.

"category": "contribute",
"content": "There are many ways to contribute to passbolt, and one them is to help translate the application into your language. Contributions are always welcome, and different tasks can be addressed depending on your profile. As a translator you could help translate strings or proofread the translated strings. As a technical profile you could help identify missing translations and externalise them in the source code.General guidelinesSource languagePassbolt has been developed in British English and so this language is not considered as a language to translatepassbolt into. If you discovered an error in this language or a string not available for translation:  and you have a technical profile please refer to the how to externalize strings section.  or you do not have a technical profile, please open a ticket on the community forum.Tone of voiceIt depends mainly on the language, but translators should always keep in mind that the application shouldn‚Äôt offend itsusers. By instance, in French ‚Äúyou‚Äù can be translated in two different manners, the chosen form defines the relationshipone person has with another, and choosing the wrong form can be perceived negatively. In the French context thetranslation should always prefer the use of the formal formulation such as ‚Äúvous‚Äù for ‚Äúyou‚Äù.InclusionInclusion is a passbolt value. Translations which exclude people based on their gender, ethnicity or any discriminativeattributes must be avoided. Neutral formulation should always be preferred when possible. For example, we use ‚Äúthey‚Äù instead of ‚Äúshe‚Äù or ‚Äúhe‚Äù. While this might not always be possible in your language, try to find a gender-neutral form.Translate passboltThe translation of passbolt is entirely managed by CrowdIn and everybody can access it to propose a contribution.Connect to CrowdInYou will need first to create a CrowdIn account or connect with a third party  account (Google, Github ‚Ä¶) to be able to contribute to the translations. Go to https://passbolt.crowdin.com and sign in or sign up if you don‚Äôt have an account yet.Select your languageFind the language you want to contribute to on the CrowdIn passbolt project page at https://passbolt.crowdin.com/passbolt.If your language is missing, and you would like to promote it, please open a ticket on the community forum.Note: Passbolt is currently translated only in French, however other languages such as German and Spanish are already in the works and will soon be available for translators and proofreaders.Translate strings or fix a translation errorOnce you have selected your language, you will be redirected to the CrowdIn translation editor.        fig. translation editorSelect a string that is not yet translated (‚ñ†) in the left panel ‚ë†. You can of course have access to all translated strings (‚ñ†) in the very same panel if you want to propose another translation.Translate the selected string from the central panel ‚ë°. CrowdIn will propose you suggestions ‚ë¢ to help translate but also to align with the tone and choice of words used in the application (suggestions marked with Passbolt‚Äôs Translation memory).If the strings to be translated are not clear you can request a context ‚ë£, the community or a translation manager will answer your question and can provide you with a screenshot where the strings are used if necessary.Access to the glossary or translation memory search tools are available if necessary in the right panel ‚ë§ of the application.Proofread passboltThe proofreading of passbolt is central in the translation process, it helps to keep a translation accurate andguarantee a global homogeneity of it. As for the translation the proofreading step is entirely managed by Crowdin.Become a proofreaderThe proofreader role can be requested to the passbolt team by email at contact@passbolt.com.The role attribution is made as per the following rules:      Contributors should have already proposed translations for the language they want to help with proofreading. If notranslation made on passbolt, the contributors can show contributions made on another open source project.        The already proposed translations should reflect the attention to details of the contributors and meet with the quality standard of passbolt.        The contributors should have proven good communication skills in their previous exchanges with the passbolt team as well as other contributors. See the passbolt code of conduct to know more about what is expected from the passbolt community members.

Sometimes multiple translations are proposed and are available in the right panel, in that case you can arbitrate them ‚ë¢ and select the one that works the best.If none of the translations are correct for the selected string you can either translate the string ‚ë£ yourselfor move to the next string.Externalize strings or fix source languageA string is available for translation only if it has been externalized in the source code of the passbolt applications, and the source code is already in the pre-release state.Note: As mentioned in the introduction of this document, British English is the language used to develop the application.
