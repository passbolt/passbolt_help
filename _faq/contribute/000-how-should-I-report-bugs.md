If you have ever seen a piece of software that functions exactly as it's supposed to 100% of the time...
nevermind, that is an improbable dream. 

## Reporting a bug
We work hard to squash the bugs in passbolt, so if you find 
something not quite right, please file an issue on our github repo.

* Make sure you have a [GitHub account](https://github.com/signup/free).
* Submit an [issue](https://github.com/passbolt/passbolt/issues)
  * Check first that a similar issue does not already exist.
  * Make sure you fill in the earliest version that you know has the issue if it is a bug.
  * Clearly describe the issue including steps to reproduce the bug
