Passbolt v4.5.0 named "Summer is Ending" brings a host of new features and improvements, all designed to make your password management experience more secure, efficient, and user-friendly.

At the heart of this release is the introduction of the Password Expiry feature, a much-anticipated functionality that allows administrators to enable the automatic expiry policy, enhancing security by ensuring that potentially passwords are rotated when someone loses access to resources, for example by leaving a group or the organization.

Alongside, we're excited to introduce the Russian translation, making Passbolt more accessible to a wider audience.

We've also expanded our SMTP settings to include Microsoft 365 and Outlook providers, responding to the community's feedback for more integration options. The section to help users install and configure the Windows desktop application feature is also now enabled by default.

Improvements in the performance of some important API endpoints and other security enhancements and bug fixes are also part of this release.

Thanks to everyone in our community for your ongoing support and contributions that made this release possible. Your feedback and involvement continue to shape Passbolt, enhancing our collective security and usability. Together, we're making password management better for everyone.
