Community Edition v3.11 introduces new features and enhancements to your passbolt experience. 

Duo v4 MFA support is now available in the browser, an update from the previously supported v2. The API also now features a new endpoint that allows administrators to get paginated action logs, to make it easier to browse and find specific events or actions programmatically. In addition, the browser extension is now available in Italian, Portuguese, Korean, and Romanian (these languages are in beta, let passbolt know if you find anything that needs updating).

As part of ongoing efforts to improve passbolt, v3.11 also deprecates PHP 7.3 support and passbolt API v2 support. While you will not be able to install a new instance on PHP 7.3, existing instances will still work until the next version. We encourage users to upgrade to PHP 7.4 or higher and use the latest version of the passboltâ€™s API. 

Passbolt appreciates the support of the community and the contributions we receive. Thank you for choosing passbolt, users play an integral role in growth and development.
