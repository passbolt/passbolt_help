## About Passbolt help site

This repository contains the code used for the knowledge base and help section of passbolt website.
Find out more about passbolt here:
[https://www.passbolt.com](https://www.passbolt.com "Passbolt Homepage")

### Quick start
This site is developed using Jekyll.
To get started please read Jekyll [quick start guide](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/quickstart/).

```
gem install jekyll bundler
git clone https://github.com/passbolt/passbolt_help.git
cd passbolt_help
bundle exec jekyll build
```

### Editing the look and feel
Do not edit the style directly by editing the CSS on this repository.
Passbolt help relies on [passbolt styleguide](https://github.com/passbolt/passbolt_styleguide).
If you want to extend the styles make a pull request on the styleguide and apply the latest version
of the styleguide to passbolt help. This is to ensure we provide a consistent user experience accross 
all the passbolt websites.

Since the styleguide is distributed as a npm module you can link your local passbolt help to your custom 
styleguide to test changes and extend the look and feel. 
See [npm-link](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/link) for more information.

### Adding images
Similarly if you want to add images to this site make sure you do not include them in assets folders that are
reserved by the styleguide such as `/assets/img/screenshots` or `/assets/img/logo`. Instead you can place them in `/assets/img/help`.
