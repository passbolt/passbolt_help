This is a small maintenance release that addresses community reported issues related to the recently introduced Duo v4 
support and SSO features.

Also shipped with this release, is a security fix to the browser extension to prevent clickjacking attacks. With the 
upcoming SSO feature, both the passbolt API and browser extensions underwent an independent security audit by
[Cure53](https://cure53.de/). As always, detailed information from the audit will be made available on the 
dedicated incident page.

Thank you to the community for reporting and helping to resolve these issues.
