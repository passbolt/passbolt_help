Passbolt Pro v4.7 is a maintenance release that resolves multiple issues identified by the community. Furthermore, this release supports the commitment to improving customization options and integration features, making it easier for organizations to tailor the system to their specific needs.

A key enhancement in this release is the ability for administrators to use custom SSL certificates for SMTP and Users Directory server connections. These long-awaited features are particularly beneficial for organizations operating in air-gapped environments or those using their own root CAs, enabling passbolt to more securely integrate with internal tools. All of these customizations are visible in the API status report of the administration workspace, providing a clear and manageable overview for administrators.

Moreover, the integration with user directories has been improved, now enabling the synchronization of user accounts using multiple fields as email identifiers. This allows organizations with heterogeneous data environments to synchronize more seamlessly with passbolt. This improvement is part of a broader initiative aimed at modernizing the integration with your user directories. Stay tuned, more enhancements are planned for future releases.
