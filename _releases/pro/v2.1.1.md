This release introduces a new dark theme that you can use in the place of the black on white
default theme. The goal for this theme was to be easier on the eye for people who stare at the screen for a long
period of time (sounds familiar?).

To switch to this new dark theme, click on your profile and select the theme option in the navigation. 
Because of this new feature, a database migration is required for this release.
Make sure you follow the [update procedure](/hosting/update).
