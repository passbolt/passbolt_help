Passbolt Pro Edition since v2.5 and CE since 3.9 support Yubikey OTP as a multi factor authentication option.
Yubico OTP is a simple authentication mechanism that is supported by all YubiKeys out of the box. 

{% include messages/notice.html
    content="Please note that only [Yubikey 5 Series](https://www.yubico.com/products/yubikey-5-overview/) are supported. [Security Keys](https://www.yubico.com/products/security-key/) with FIDO2/U2F/WebAuthN support are currently not supported."

## Security considerations

It is important to enable and setup at least one additional multi factor authentication provider in 
case the user lose its Yubikey or the the Yubicloud service becomes temporarily not available.

During a login attempt the passbolt will check if the key ID used by the user is the same that was 
used during setup. To change key (if the key was lost for example) a user will need to first disable 
the Yubikey provider in their settings.

## Get a Yubikey cloud api key

In order to use Yubikey OTP you need to get an API key for Yubicloud, Yubico’s web service for verifying OTPs. 
Please note that it is no longer possible to [host yourself the OTP validation server](https://support.yubico.com/hc/en-us/articles/360021227000-YK-VAL-YK-KSM-and-YubiHSM-1-End-of-Life){:target="_blank"}.

    legend="Yubicloud registration"
    width="550px"
%}

Before using YubiCloud, you need to get an API key from [upgrade.yubico.com](https://upgrade.yubico.com/getapikey/){:target="_blank"} 
in order to prevent misuse of the service. You will need to authenticate yourself using a Yubikey One-Time Password 
and provide your e-mail address as a reference, as well as read and accept the terms of service.

## Make sure YubiCloud urls are whitelisted

In order to verify a Yubikey OTP passbolt will need to connect to YubiCloud.
If you prevent outgoing connection from Passbolt server to the following domains:
- api.yubico.com
- api2.yubico.com
- api3.yubico.com
- api4.yubico.com
- api5.yubico.com

One or more of these domains may be used to try to validate an OTP.

## Set the configuration in passbolt

You can configure Yubikey OTP using either the admin interface or environment variables. If multiple 
settings providers are used the settings in the admin interface will override the one used in environment variables.

### Using admin user interface

A user interface is provided for administrators to setup MFA providers.
Click on "administration" in the top menu, then "multi-factor authentication" on the left menu.
You can then enable or disable the Yubikey provider by providing the user id and secret key that
you gathered in the previous steps. Click "save settings" when you are done.

### Using environment variables

If you are [using docker](/hosting/install/ce/docker.html), you can set these environment variables to configure your Yubikey:

<table class="table-parameters">
<thead>
    <tr>
        <th>Variable name</th>
        <th>Description</th>
        <th>Type</th>
    </tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
    <tr>
        <td>PASSBOLT_PLUGINS_MFA_YUBIKEY_SECRETKEY</td>
        <td>Yubicloud secret key</td>
        <td>string</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>PASSBOLT_PLUGINS_MFA_YUBIKEY_CLIENTID</td>
        <td>Yubicloud client id</td>
        <td>integer</td>
    </tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<br>

## Setting Yubikey for a given passbolt user account

Once you have the Yubikey integration configured and Yubikey plugged in your computer you
can proceed with enabling Yubikey as provider for your user account. It is important you test
this to make sure the integration works.

    url="/assets/img/help/2018/11/mfa-providers.png"
    legend="MFA provider selection for passbolt user"
    width="550px"
%}

When logged in passbolt go to your profile section and click on "Multi-factor authentication"
in the left sidebar. You should see the list of providers that are enabled for this instance.
Click on the Yubikey provider. Passbolt will then prompt you to touch your Yubikey
to enter a one time password.

The next time you try login from a new device, you will be presented with a Yubikey 
authentication prompt.
