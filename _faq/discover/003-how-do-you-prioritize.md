Upcoming new funtionalities are advertised on the [roadmap](https://www.passbolt.com/roadmap).
Passbolt users can propose and upvote for new ideas on the [community forum](https://community.passbolt.com).
The more financial contributors (and supporters in general) the quicker we can develop new functionalities.

Security vulnerabilities and bugs fixes are to be given a higher priority than new features.
Core libraries and framework maintenance upgrade also need to be dealt with proactively.
