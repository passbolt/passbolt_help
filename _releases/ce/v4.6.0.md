The Passbolt Community Edition 4.6.0 release "Purple Haze", brings enhancements that focus primarily on the administrative aspect and overall system health.

This update introduces the Health Check feature within the Admin workspace, designed to offer administrators a comprehensive tool for system assessment and upkeep.
In addition, this version addresses a range of minor bugs and delivers the awaited PHP 8.3 support.

This version furthermore lays the foundations for successive performance gains by refining data verification processes and reducing memory usage, particularly when browsing. Expect more significant improvements with the next releases.
