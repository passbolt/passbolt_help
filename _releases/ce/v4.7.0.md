Passbolt Community Edition v4.7 is a maintenance release that resolves multiple issues identified by the community. Furthermore, this release supports the commitment to improving customization options and integration features, making it easier for organizations to tailor the system to their specific needs.

A key enhancement in this release is the ability to use custom SSL certificates for SMTP server connections. This long-awaited feature is particularly beneficial for organizations operating in air-gapped environments or those using their own root CAs, enabling passbolt to more securely integrate with internal tools.
