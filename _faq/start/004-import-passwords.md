### Steps
1.  Click on the "import" button at the top left, next to the "create" button.
2.  Select a file (supported files are kdbx or csv. More details below.)
3.  Click on "continue import"
4.  For kdbx files, you might need to enter a password. Enter it and click "Ok".
5.  The import will start. You will see a progress bar.
6.  At the end of the import, you will see a report. After closing this window, you will see the passwords imported in your workspace.
