## 3. Configure your administrator account

### 3.2. Create a new key

Passbolt will ask you to create or import a key that will be later use to identify you and encrypt your passwords.
Your key needs to be protected by a password. Choose it wisely, it will be the gatekeeper to all your other passwords.

### 3.3. Download your recovery kit

This step is essential. Your key is the only way to access your account and passwords. If you lose this key (by breaking
or losing your computer and not having a backup for example), your encrypted data will be lost even if you remember your
passphrase.

### 3.4. Define your security token

Choosing a color and a three characters token is a secondary security mechanism that helps you to mitigate phishing
attacks. Each time you are performing a sensitive operation on passbolt, you should see this token.
