This is a small maintenance release addressing community reported issues related to the recently introduced Duo v4 support.

This release also includes a security fix for the browser extension to mitigate clickjacking attacks discovered during 
an independent security audit of the API and browser extension by [Cure53](https://cure53.de/). As always, detailed 
findings will be published on our dedicated incident page soon.

Thank you to the members of the community whoâ€™ve reported issues and helped us fix them.
