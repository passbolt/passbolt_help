This tutorial covers the case where you want to upgrade your current instance of passbolt CE v2.x into Passbolt Pro.

{% include messages/warning.html
    content="**Important:** Please take a full [backup](/hosting/backup) of your Passbolt CE before proceeding with the upgrade. Backup should include passbolt files as well as the database."
%}

## System requirements
{% include hosting/v2-requirements.md %}

## Upgrade to Passbolt Pro
In the following examples we assume you are running passbolt using apache in the `/var/www/passbolt`
directory. You will need to replace these values with your local environment settings.

### 1. Take your site offline & install the required modules
{% include hosting/upgrade/take-your-site-offline.md %}

If you are planning to use LDAP integration you will need to make sure the PHP extension for LDAP
is installed and enabled (for example: `apt-get install php-ldap`). Make sure you restart your webserver
when you add new PHP extensions (for example with: `sudo service restart php-fpm`).

### 2. Download Passbolt Pro
{% include hosting/upgrade/pro/v2/download-and-replace-passbolt.md 
    repo_url="https://bitbucket.org/passbolt_pro/passbolt_pro_api.git"
%}

### 3. Install the dependencies
{% include hosting/install/install-composer-dependencies.md %}

### 4. Copy the avatar folder
```shell
/var/www/passbolt$ cp -R ../passbolt_old/webroot/img/public/* ./webroot/img/public/.
```

### 5. Configure Passbolt Pro
{% include hosting/install/pro/v2/install-with-webinstaller.md %}

### 6. Your server is now ready to run passbolt

Once you have followed all the steps of the wizard, Passbolt Pro is ready to run. You will be redirected
automatically to the login page where you can log in.

## That's it!

At this stage, Passbolt Pro should be working perfectly.

Any issue? Do contact us on the [Passbolt Pro support](mailto:contact@passbolt.com) with the email provided during your purchase.
