In short the server generate a challenge thatmust be decrypted and returned by the user. It also contains a challenge to verify the user server key.Challenge based authentication is different that form based authentication, you can learn more about the differenceon this page.Sequence diagramThe authentication process works by the two-way exchange of encrypted and signed tokens(nonces) between the user andthe server. The authentication process is as follows:        fig. Sequence diagram of a GPGAuth-based authenticationCustom response headersThe server uses a set of custom HTTP headers to send information to the client related to the authentication.It will be easier to understand their use in the steps that follow, but a brief description of some of them isprovided here:            Header      Description             X-GPGAuth-Verify-Response       The challenge response, e.g. the secret the server needed to decrypt. The client compares it with the one    stored locally and confirms server‚Äôs identity.          X-GPGAuth-Progress   The current login stage number. Possible values are verify, stage0, stage1, complete and logout.          X-GPGAuth-User-Auth-Token   An encrypted token sent from the server for the client to decrypt in order to confirm its identity.          X-GPGAuth-Refer   URI of the last location which triggered the login process. Used to redirect back after a successful login.          X-GPGAuth-Error   Any information with regards to an authentication error          X-GPGAuth-Pubkey   The server public key url          X-GPGAuth-Logout-Url   The logout URL          X-GPGAuth-Version   GPGAuth version       Authentication sequence detailsVerify StepThe verify step is used to verify your passbolt server identity. It is useful in some security cases such aswhen a domain name is seized. This server identity verification should not be understood as an end-to-end serverauthentication, e.g. it does not protect against an attacker performing a man in the middle attack.Though this step is optional, it is recommended for a client to verify the server key. It involves:  The client generates a token(nonce) in a specific format. It must have the pattern of version, UUID length,v4 UUID, and version (separated with pipes):    gpgauthv1.3.0|36|10e2074b-f610-42be-8525-100d4e68c481|gpgauthv1.3.0        The client then encrypts the token with the server‚Äôs broadcasted public keyand stores the unencrypted version of the token locally, for future use.    The encrypted token is sent to the server along with the user key fingerprint.Make a POST request to /auth/verify.json and send the token in the request body under gpg_auth[‚Äòserver_verify_token‚Äô]:    'data' =&gt; [ 'gpg_auth' =&gt; [     'keyid' =&gt; &lt;fingerprint_of_the_user&gt;,     'server_verify_token' =&gt; &lt;Encrypted_token&gt; ]]        Based on the user key fingerprint the server checks if the user exists and is active. If the fingerprint is verified, the server decrypts the token and checks if it is in the valid format.  If in a valid format, the server sends back the decrypted token: in the response look for the X-GPGAuth-Verify-Response header.  The client checks if the token matches the unencrypted one stored locally. If it does not match the client warns the user that the server identity cannot be verified.  The client proceeds to the login step only if the local unencrypted token matches the server‚Äôs decrypted token.Login StepSteps Overview  The client sends the user key fingerprint to the server.  The server checks to see if the fingerprint is valid and if the user associated with it is active. It then generates a token of random data, stores an unencrypted version locally, and then creates an encrypted version of the token as well.  The server sends the encrypted token to the client.  The client prompts the user to enter their private key passphrase, the client decrypts the encrypted server token and checks the token format.  The client sends back the decrypted token along with the user key fingerprint again.  The server compares the decrypted token sent from the client to make sure it matches its locally stored unencrypted token from step 2. If the server is satisfied, the authentication is completed as with a normal form-based login: a session is started.Step 1 detailTo get your GPG key fingerprint, you can use the gpg --fingerprint command. It will output a list of fingerprint thecurrent user has access to.$ gpg --fingerprintÔªø/home/ada/.gnupg/pubring.kbx-----------------------------pub   rsa4096 2015-10-26 [SC] [expires: 2019-10-26]      03F6¬†0E95¬†8F4C¬†B297¬†23AC¬†¬†DF76¬†1353¬†B5B1¬†5D9B¬†054Fuid           [ unknown] Ada Lovelace &lt;ada@passbolt.com&gt;sub   rsa4096 2015-10-26 [E] [expires: 2019-10-26]It is also possible to retrieve your fingerprint via the passbolt app. Once logged in, navigate to your user‚Äôs Profile, and selectKeys Inspector (URL path: /app/settings/keys).The client sends the fingerprint of the user‚Äôs key via a POST request.POST /auth/login.json'data' =&gt; [    'gpg_auth' =&gt; [        'keyid' =&gt; &lt;fingerprint_of_the_user&gt;    ]]Step 2 detailStep 2a: A matching key is found on the server, and the user is active. The server then generates a random token,stores it locally and then encrypts it with the user‚Äôs public key.Step 2b: A matching key is not found, or one is found but it belongs to an inactive user. The server returns aHTTP 404 NOT FOUND  response meaning the user with the given fingerprint is not granted access to your passbolt server.Step 3 detailThe encrypted token is then sent in theX-GPGAuth-User-Auth-Token header to the client. An example response looks like this.X-GPGAuth-Authenticated: falseX-GPGAuth-Login-URL: /auth/loginX-GPGAuth-Logout-URL: /auth/logoutX-GPGAuth-Progress: stage1X-GPGAuth-Pubkey-URL: /auth/verify.jsonX-GPGAuth-User-Auth-Token: -----BEGIN\\+PGP\\+MESSAGE-----X-GPGAuth-Verify-URL: /auth/verifyX-GPGAuth-Version: 1.3.0        For readability the usual response headers like Cache-Control, Content-Type, Date, Expires etc. are omitted above.        Step 4 detailThe client asks the user the private key passphrase. Then with the private key, the client decrypts the token given by the server and verifies its format.Step 5 detailThe token is returned encoded as a url. To be used, it first needs to be decoded.Decode token with PHPIf you have php installed, you can use this command:echo \"&lt;token&gt;\" | php -r \"echo stripslashes(urldecode(file_get_contents('php://stdin')));\"Decode token using a browser consoleAlternatively, you could use the console of your browser with Javascript to decode the key:var uri = \"-----BEGIN\\+PGP\\+MESSAGE----- ...\"decodeURIComponent(uri)Using this browser console approach will still leave plus(+) signs in the header and footer which must be replacedwith spaces.Decrypt tokenNow that the token has been decoded, the client then decrypts the encrypted token:echo \"&lt;encrypted_token_from_server&gt;\" | gpg -dThe user‚Äôs private key passphrase will be required for decryption while also serving to verify the ownership of thefingerprint sent in step 1.The client must verify the token for proper format. Otherwise, there is a risk than an attacker uses this channel todecrypt othercontent. The token format must look like:gpgauthv1.3.0|36|10e2074b-f610-42be-8525-100d4e68c481|gpgauthv1.3.0After decrypting, the client will send the decrypted (plaintext) data back to the server for verification.POST /auth/login.json'data' =&gt; [    'gpg_auth' =&gt; [        'keyid' =&gt; &lt;same_fingerprint_as_step1&gt;,        'user_token_result' =&gt; &lt;decrypted_token_in_plaintext&gt;    ]]Step 6 detailFinally, the server verifies the plaintext token against the one stored locally in step 2 and upon success:  Initiates a session  Logs the user in  Generates a secure token and sends to the client as a cookie called ‚ÄúcsrfToken‚ÄùWorking with CSRF tokenTo prevent Cross Site Request Forgery (‚ÄúCSRF attacks‚Äù) aCSRF token must be included in all future requests that affect the integrity of the data (e.g. a resource edit, auser delete action). This makes sure that an attacker cannot create a malicious website that wouldtrigger an action in passbolt (e.g. preventing ‚Äúclickjacking‚Äù).        Currently the csrfToken cookie is not returned in the same Success response in Step 5 above. A simple GET call    to /users/me.json will allow for the client to receive the cookie. This cookie can then be submitted through a special     X-CSRF-Token header. Using a header often makes it easier to integrate a CSRF token with applications consuming the API.        Working with MFAPassbolt Pro Edition currently supports logging in using multi factor authentication (MFA). Your script will need tocater for these scenarios if the account you are using has MFA enabled. After login, or when the current MFAauthorization session expires, if MFA is required the current request will be redirected using the HTTP 403 FORBIDDENcode.{  \"header\": {    \"id\": \"b90fc548-236c-4e69-a6f6-27137e3acd0f\",    \"status\": \"error\",    \"servertime\": 1555513784,    \"action\": \"af9aa2c6-7355-514d-a4a0-3e74de4c0fdb\",    \"message\": \"MFA authentication is required.\",    \"url\": \"/mfa/verify/error.json\",    \"code\": 403  },  \"body\": {    \"providers\": {      \"totp\": \"https://my.passbolt.io/mfa/verify/totp.json\"    }  }}The response lists the available options. It is possible to redirect the user there or for some providers, such asTOTP (Google Authenticator) or HOTP (Yubikey), to implement this logic directly inside yourapplication with additional interactions.For example you can post the MFA credentials for TOTP provider as follow:fetch('/mfa/verify/totp.json', {  method: 'POST',  headers: {    'Content-Type': 'application/json; charset=utf-8',    'X-CSRF-Token': crsfToken  },  body: {'totp': otp}});For some other providers like Duo, it requires you to have the ability to embed an iframe.",

"title": "Form-based vs. Challenge-Based Authentication",
"category": "api,form-vs-challenge",
"content": "IntroductionInstead of a conventional form-based login system, passbolt uses the GpgAuth protocolfor authenticating its clients. It is a challenge-based authentication similar to what you would find in a protocol such as SSH. Our goals were both to improve the security and usability of the overall solution.Form-based authenticationWhile some web apps today defer to another service such as Google or Facebook to handle the authentication, most still support a form-based authentication by default.The process goes as follows:        fig. Sequence diagram of a form-based authenticationDuring the registration step of a typical web app, the password is sent (ideally over HTTPS) to the server. This password is then salted and hashed using bcrypt (or equivalent) and stored for future use by the server. A salt known only by this application instance is used to prevent brute force cracking of the password in case its hash gets leaked (via a SQL injection, for example).During a subsequent login by the user, the password is sent and in a process similar to the original registration, the server hashes it and compares it with the stored version. If the hashes match then the server stores a session token that is sent back as a cookie (or url parameter) which is also set on the client side. This cookie is then produced by the client for each request for the duration of the session (until the cookie expires, the user logs out, or the server terminates the session).The problem with form-based authenticationThe main issue is one of usability. Using this approach for passbolt would mean that a user would need to remember yet another password on top of their private key passphrase. This goes against the basic benefit of having a password manager.If a login password was required, we would also have to store the password in the authentication plugin. But this would complicate our requirements as it would then mandate the development of additional procedures for a passbolt user‚Äôs account password to be created, updated and recovered.Another inherent dilemma to this approach is the potential inability for the user to reset their password using an email verification, in case the password to their email client is stored in passbolt.There are also other issues not specific to passbolt‚Äôs requirements but still worth trying to fix with an approach other than form-based:  Phishing: it is possible for an attacker to mimic the passbolt login page and trick a user into entering their credentials. Traditional form-based authentication does not perform server identity verification: it is the responsibility of the user to verify if the URL is correct and SSL certificates are valid.  Password quality: password fatigue generally leads to password reuse, poor rotation and weak strength. Although stricter validation can be implemented on the server side to improve password quality, this quality is achieved only by placing an additional burden on the user.",

"title": "Passbolt API Documentation",
"category": "api",
"content": "IntroductionThis document describes passbolt server component API. The API works over HTTPS in a REST fashion, so it islanguage framework agnostic. You can integrate passbolt services into your existing workflow using thetoolset of your choice.Getting StartedTo get started with the passbolt REST API (hereafter referred to as ‚ÄúThe API‚Äù) you need at least:  A running passbolt server instance.  A passbolt user account if you want to access protected data.  Some basic understanding of how public key cryptography works.  An OpenPGP-compliant library to build with.Base URLThe API is served over HTTPS. All URLs referenced in the documentation omit the base urlof your passbolt installation domain such as:https://&lt;passbolt.your-organization.com&gt;.Response formatResponse envelopeThe API returns data in an envelope with ‚Äúheader‚Äù and ‚Äúbody‚Äù properties.The ‚Äúheader‚Äù contains response metadata like response code, server_time, error messages etc.The ‚Äúbody‚Äù contains the actual payload.For example, requesting a single resource by id will result in something like:{    \"header\": {        \"id\": \"799c69c7-1789-4d87-9fbf-02529b0d21dc\",        \"status\": \"success\",        \"servertime\": 1554909967,        \"action\": \"ad71952e-7842-599e-a19e-3a82e6974b23\",        \"message\": \"The operation was successful.\",        \"url\": \"\\/secrets\\/resource\\/8e3874ae-4b40-590b-968a-418f704b9d9a.json\",        \"code\": 200    },    \"body\": {        \"id\": \"eede75ff-316a-511c-8317-51e8339b6dcc\",        \"user_id\": \"f848277c-5398-58f8-a82a-72397af2d450\",        \"resource_id\": \"8e3874ae-4b40-590b-968a-418f704b9d9a\",        \"resource_type_id\": \"e2aa01a9-84ec-55f8-aaed-24ee23259339\",        \"data\": \"-----BEGIN PGP MESSAGE-----\",        \"created\": \"2019-04-04T12:06:50+00:00\",        \"modified\": \"2019-04-04T12:06:50+00:00\"    }}        Notice: The title under header is deprecated and will be removed in future release.    Similarly, the code is only indicated to improve readability for an administrator when debugging and should    not be relied on.        Error responsesAn unsuccessful operation will result in an error response. The error response will follow the same scheme as abovewith the presence of both ‚Äúheader‚Äù and ‚Äúbody‚Äù properties, only this time the status in the header will be set toerror instead of success. The response body will contain the error details.{    \"header\": {        \"id\": \"965c9f17-18ae-48fd-a36e-e42f04a30442\",        \"status\": \"error\",        \"servertime\": 1554907648,        \"action\": \"ad8bbc35-6435-538e-b1a7-80b87bcedb6a\",        \"message\": \"Could not validate resource data.\",        \"url\": \"\\/resources.json\",        \"code\": 400    },    \"body\": {        \"name\": {            \"_required\": \"A name is required.\"        },        \"secrets\": {            \"_required\": \"A secret is required.\"        }    }}As you can see, for validation errors, the response body contains two keys, ‚Äúname‚Äù and ‚Äúsecrets‚Äù as they failedsome validation rules. Further, they also have their own json object with a key (‚Äú_required‚Äù) that represents thevalidation rule that failed and a value with the actual error message (‚ÄúA name is required‚Äù).API VersionsHistorically, passbolt supported two different formats for interacting with the API. API version 1 is now deprecated.The passbolt server component supports only API version 2 and all calls are assumed to be version 2 - no parameter is neededto designate this.You can see the complete changelog on the officialthe repository.Encryption and decryptionSecurity and privacy are the biggest concerns for a password manager and passbolt is no exception.Passbolt‚Äôs solution uses end-to-end encryption and the encryption and decryption is always done on the client. The serveris mainly used to take care of relational data integrity and storage.Passbolt uses public key cryptographyand OpenPGP specifically. This guide will assume you are familiar with these concepts.        fig. password exchange using passboltWhich OpenPGP implementation should I use?There are several ways you can use OpenPGP. The most popular option is to use GnuPG(directly or via GPGME) or another implementation in yourfavorite language.There are various language libraries available such as:  OpenPGP.js: JavaScript alone (used by passbolt extension / cli)  PHP GnuPG: PHP with GnuPG (used by passbolt server)  OpenPGP.php: PHP alone (used by passbolt server).  gpgme.js: JavaScript for GPGME  GPGME Python: Python with GnuPG.  PGPy: Python alone.You can find additional libraries on openpgp.org.Working with OpenPGP KeysAt the time of installation the passbolt server administrator generates an OpenPGP key pair and stores it inthe server keyring. Similarly, clients (such as the passbolt browser extension) generate a pair of keys during the setup.At the end of the setup the client stores its secret key locally and send the public key to the server.When authenticated, it is possible for a user to gather other user‚Äôs public keys, in order to share passwords with them.Prior to sending sensitive data, secrets must be encrypted using the recipient‚Äôs public key (e.g. another user, for example) and signed using the sender‚Äôs public key.This serves two purposes:  Privacy by encrypting the data and  Authenticity by confirming the identity of the sender.Accessing passbolt server public keyThe passbolt server public key is required during the ‚Äúverify‚Äù step of the authentication. This step allows theclient to verify the server identity, for example to prevent the unlikely scenario where the domain was seized.Your passbolt server broadcasts its public key at /auth/verify.json:GET /auth/verify.json{    \"header\": {        \"id\": \"6f416b88-8062-4e94-ab00-259a4cd2e085\",        \"status\": \"success\",        \"servertime\": 1554898043,        \"action\": \"748dcd10-7d15-5498-9aa6-d26de348ff02\",        \"message\": \"The operation was successful.\",        \"url\": \"\\/auth\\/verify.json\",        \"code\": 200    },    \"body\": {        \"fingerprint\": \"2FC8945833C51946E937F9FED47B0811573EE67E\",        \"keydata\": \"-----BEGIN PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----\"    }}",

Sharing a ResourceSharing a Resource involves the following steps.  Get the id of the Resource you want to share.  Get the id of the ARO you want to share it with.  Encrypt the plaintext secret for all users using their public keys.  Send the ASCII armored encrypted message for each of the affected users to the API.The payload takes a json object with keys for ‚Äúpermissions‚Äù and ‚Äúsecrets‚Äù. The ‚Äúpermission‚Äù key contains a json array where each object represents a Permission object for a user. While the ‚Äúsecrets‚Äù key contains a json array where each object represents a Secret object. At the very least, it contains the user_id and OpenPGP encrypted armored message.To generate the encrypted message, you can use$ echo &lt;plaintext_password&gt; | gpg -r &lt;gpg_uid&gt; -e -aThe search-aros endpoint described above outputs the gpg details for individual users like their armored_key, uid, key_id and fingerprint. For Groups, you can make a GET request to /groups/&lt;group_id&gt;.json endpoint. For more info, check the View a group page.        Based on the trust level of the public key gpg might complain about There is no assurance this key belongs to the named user If you trust the key, you can proceed by responding ‚Äòy‚Äô        Upon confirmation, gpg outputs the ascii armored message$ echo &lt;plaintext_password&gt; | gpg -r &lt;gpg_uid&gt; -e -a-----BEGIN PGP MESSAGE-----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2F87-----END PGP MESSAGE-----This needs to be done for each user gaining access to the secretSo the request body will look like{  \"permissions\": [    {      \"is_new\": true,      \"aro\": \"Group\",      \"aro_foreign_key\": \"36563004-3f25-50c0-b22e-6554c3ccc4e7\",      \"aco\": \"Resource\",      \"aco_foreign_key\": \"8e3874ae-4b40-590b-968a-418f704b9d9a\",      \"type\": 7    }],  \"secrets\": [    {      \"user_id\": \"8d04cf98-716b-5f6d-9fe8-c130f8992646\",      \"data\":\"-----BEGIN PGP MESSAGE-----\"    }  ]}Simulate SharingPassbolt API allows you to simulate a share before actually going through with this.

To retrieve the plaintext password, you must decrypt it using the associated secret key.{% include messages/notice.html    content=\"The plaintext password is encrypted using the user's public key it's shared with. So to decrypt it, you must have secret/private key of that user in your keyring.\"%}In the example above, the string under the key `data` is the encrypted plaintext password. To decrypt it to retrieve the plaintext password, you can use `gpg -d` or `gpg --decrypt` command. Here is an example```bash$ echo \"\" | gpg -d```It should output the plaintext password on the console.```bash$ echo \"\" | gpg -dgpg: encrypted with 4096-bit RSA key, ID 7A8E6D66F5DC4C49, created 2019-03-13      \"Abhinav Kumar \"hello  ``` In the example above \"hello\" is the plaintext password.",

"category": "configure",
"content": "Table of contents:  Table of contents:  Introduction  Database  PHP FPM  NginxIntroductionAt Passbolt, we are constantly striving to enhance performance, introduce new functionality, and refine existing features.The default settings that come with Passbolt are suitable for the majority of our users. However, if you have a significant number of users or groups who have access to hundreds or thousands of secrets, the defaults may not meet your performance expectations.To address this, we have created this guide to help you optimize Passbolt‚Äôs performance.If you prefer not to make these adjustments, please let us know which areas of Passbolt are slowing down for you, and we will consider incorporating improvements in future releases.Database            Important: This assumes you are running your database on the same host as your Passbolt installation        One database improvement that can be made is to skip the reverse DNS lookup in MySQL/MariaDB. To do this you will need to:Ensure the passbolt user in the database is allowed to connect via 127.0.0.1 and not just localhost:[mysql]&gt; GRANT USAGE ON *.* TO `passboltadmin`@`127.0.0.1` IDENTIFIED BY PASSWORD `&lt;insert password hash here&gt;`;[mysql]&gt; GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON `passboltdb`.* TO `passboltadmin`@`127.0.0.1`;[mysql]&gt; FLUSH PRIVILEGES;You can find the password hash by running:[mysql]&gt; use mysql;[mysql]&gt; select user, host, password from user where user = ‚Äòpassboltadmin‚Äô;Both above samples assume user is named passboltadmin and the database is named passboltdb, actual values may be different depending on what was chosen during installation.Edit your mysql configuration file, search for [mysqld] block and add:# Skip reverse DNS lookupskip-name-resolveThen restart mysql:systemctl restart mysqlYou will then need to adjust your Passbolt configuration to point to 127.0.0.1 instead of localhost if it is set to localhostPHP FPMThere are two values which you can change to increase the resources that PHP is able to use. These are memory_limit and pm.max_childrenYou can adjust memory_limit by editing the /etc/php/X.X/fpm/php.ini file where X.X is your PHP version.You can adjust pm.max_children by editing the /etc/php/X.X/fpm/pool.d/www.conf file where X.X is your PHP version.            Since you edited the php configuration, you will need to restart php-fpm to apply those changes. It‚Äôs important to run sudo systemctl restart phpX.X-fpm where X.X is your PHP version        NginxFor Nginx our recommendation is less about making it more performant, but rather increasing a timeout so that your users don‚Äôt experience as many errors if they are regularly running into time outs. You can do this by editing the value for keepalive_timeout in your Nginx config file.",

We are committed to creating an environment that welcomes and embraces individuals of all genders, including those who identify as non-binary, genderqueer, or transgender. We actively encourage the participation of individuals of all genders in our community.Anti-DiscriminationWe do not tolerate discrimination based on gender, gender identity or expression, or any other characteristic protected by applicable law.

We empower others to speak and will strive to make diversity and inclusion intentional. We welcome contributions from everyone as long as they interact constructively with our community.Be concise: we try to be concise and avoid repeating what has already been said. We try to stay on topic, especially in discussions that are already fairly large.Be transparent: we are open about what we are working on to allow others to participate. We are also transparent about our mistakes to allow others tolearn and avoid repeating them.Handling issuesIf you are subject to or witness unacceptable behavior, or have any other concerns, please email us at contact@passbolt.comDate of Last UpdateThis code of conduct was last updated on November 21st, 2017.",

"content": "A browser extension is needed to provide functionalities such as auto filling your passwords when visiting known websites, but more importantly to maintain a higher level of security and provide a secure random number generator.More infoA regular website serves users content in the form of html, javascript, css assets. It may be cached on a content delivery network (CDN) for speed, but everything is coming from one place. In the event of an attacker accessing the server, they may be able to change these assets, such as showing you modified content, or change the application logic.The solution we opted-for to ensure code integrity was to split the application in two parts:  Server side: the API who serves encrypted data  Client side: the web extension who renders the assets and contains the logic to encrypt/decrypt data.The web extension is published on browsers extension marketplaces (Firefox, Chrome, Edge). Each of them requires the extension to be cryptographically signed by Passbolt developers with a secret key, to make sure nobody can change that code while it is being transmitted from the marketplace.        fig. passbolt application and data deliverySome points you must be aware of:  The passbolt login page is rendered by the browser extension. By entering your passphrase, you unlock your PGP private key stored in the local storage of your browser to let the extension communicate with the passbolt API and perform the user authentication with GnuPG protocol.  Most of passbolt application (passwords, users, or profile namespaces) isn‚Äôt rendered by the server but by the browser extension.

For example, your username, the comments or the list of people you are sharing a password with are not encrypted using OpenPGP, and are stored in plaintext both on the client and server side. Obviously passwords can be available in decrypted form at some point (the later the better), but they will never be stored in plain text on the filesystem on either the client or server side.For the data in motion, e.g. on the transport layer level, all the communication are encrypted using SSL. The strength of the security at that level is not controlled by the passbolt solution itself but rather a combination of other factors such as the level of security of the organization issuing the certificate and the operating system configuration chosen by the hosting provider.For the data at rest, for most of the clients and servers, it is also possible to encrypt the database at the file system level as well. This will add another encryption layer that can be useful, for example, in the case where the machine running passbolt is seized or stolen.",

On the client side passbolt uses OpenPGP.js as a foundation for all its cryptographic functionalities.On the server side passbolt uses both the GnuPG Php Extension and openpgp-php in order to perform public key validation and to support the GPGAuth authentication protocol.

Currently, the recommendation to solve these problems is to use a browser extension. Passbolt follows this recommendation.The other issue has to do with the quality of the javascript implementation of the cryptographic functionalities and the fact that JavaScript has its fair share of pitfalls. This is true for any programming languages and can only be addressed through careful code review. Passbolt uses OpenPGP.js for its cryptographic functionalities which have been reviewed multiple times by Cure53.Organizing more regular independent 3rd party audits is one of our main priorities.

For example you do not have any guarantee that they will fix vulnerabilities, introduce backdoors or that they will not use your data without your consent. When the source code is freely available, anyone can organize a review and check if the level of security the product provides is adequate.Some people may argue that an attacker could find vulnerabilities more easily if the code is available to everyone.While it is true, but the corollary is also true, e.g. people without malicious intent too can find these vulnerabilities and fix them, making the solution stronger in the long term.

You can use the followingcommand to send a test email and get more debug information (replace www-data with nginx if you are running a RHEL-like server, or wwwrun in case you are using openSUSE):$ sudo -H -u www-data bash -c \"/usr/share/php/passbolt/bin/cake passbolt send_test_email --recipient=youremail@domain.com\"If this fails you should double check what is the recommended configuration in your email provider documentation.You can also ask on the community forum in case another user have a working configuration for the same provider.Reason 2: Email notifications are disabled in the configAnother reason could be because email notifications are disabled in your configuration.You can review such settings in the administration panel, when you are logged in as an administrator in passbolt.        fig. Email Notification Settings - Email DeliveryReason 3: The cron system is stoppedPassbolt uses a system of email queue to send email notifications.A dedicated cron job (located in /etc/cron.d/passbolt-{ce|pro}-server) runs every minute to go through the queue and send emails.So if you manage to send the test email but are not receiving notifications (such as registration emails),one of the reason may be that the cron service is stopped.You can verify if the service is running by executing this command:sudo systemctl status cron.serviceYou can also verify cronjobs activity with this command:sudo journalctl -fu cron.serviceReason 4: There is an issue with the database schema related to the email queueIf after an update you are getting error messages such as:Exception: SQLSTATE[42S22]: Column not found: 1054 Unknown column ‚ÄòEmailQueue.to‚Äô in ‚Äòfield list‚Äô ...It is possible that the wrong version of the data model is stored in the cache. This can happenif the cache is not cleared after an install or an update. You can try clearing out the cache to solve this(replace www-data with nginx if you are running a RHEL-like server, or wwwrun in case you are using openSUSE).sudo -H -u www-data bash -c \"/usr/share/php/passbolt/bin/cake cache clear_all\"Reason 5: You are using credentials password instead of application passwordSome email providers will not let you use the password from your organization account for security purposes. It means that if you‚Äôre trying to use the authentication method ‚ÄúUsername &amp; Password‚Äù it will result in a failure if you are using something other than an application password.",

Encryption operations such as creating a private key require an enough amount of entropy on the system‚Äôs entropy pool.A good and fast source of entropy is important to generate high quality random numbers. Poor quality on the random numbers could lead to weak private keys thatcould compromise the security of your setup.Random number generation is a complex topic that has been discussed widely on the community [1]Virtualisation strongly affects the quantity of produced entropy and. In other words, when you run a virtualised system such as a virtual machine or a container you likelywill find yourself in a situation where the entropy pool is low and it is filling slowly. There are few remediations for this situation:  Use a hardware random number generation and use rng-tools  Use HavegedAs stated in [1] and [2], haveged could leadto generation of poor entropy so, in order to stay safe, the recommendation would be to:  Use rng-tools if you trust your hardware random number generator  If rng-tools is not enough then use Haveged as well.You can check the current available entropy on your system by executing this command:cat /proc/sys/kernel/random/entropy_availA good number of available entropy is usually between 2500 and 4096 bits.

"title": "How can I contribute to the translation?",
"category": "contribute",
"content": "There are many ways to contribute to passbolt, and one them is to help translate the application into your language. Contributions are always welcome, and different tasks can be addressed depending on your profile. As a translator you could help translate strings or proofread the translated strings. As a technical profile you could help identify missing translations and externalise them in the source code.General guidelinesSource languagePassbolt has been developed in British English and so this language is not considered as a language to translatepassbolt into. If you discovered an error in this language or a string not available for translation:  and you have a technical profile please refer to the how to externalize strings section.  or you do not have a technical profile, please open a ticket on the community forum.Tone of voiceIt depends mainly on the language, but translators should always keep in mind that the application shouldn‚Äôt offend itsusers. By instance, in French ‚Äúyou‚Äù can be translated in two different manners, the chosen form defines the relationshipone person has with another, and choosing the wrong form can be perceived negatively. In the French context thetranslation should always prefer the use of the formal formulation such as ‚Äúvous‚Äù for ‚Äúyou‚Äù.InclusionInclusion is a passbolt value. Translations which exclude people based on their gender, ethnicity or any discriminativeattributes must be avoided. Neutral formulation should always be preferred when possible. For example, we use ‚Äúthey‚Äù instead of ‚Äúshe‚Äù or ‚Äúhe‚Äù. While this might not always be possible in your language, try to find a gender-neutral form.Translate passboltThe translation of passbolt is entirely managed by CrowdIn and everybody can access it to propose a contribution.Connect to CrowdInYou will need first to create a CrowdIn account or connect with a third party  account (Google, Github ‚Ä¶) to be able to contribute to the translations. Go to https://passbolt.crowdin.com and sign in or sign up if you don‚Äôt have an account yet.Select your languageFind the language you want to contribute to on the CrowdIn passbolt project page at https://passbolt.crowdin.com/passbolt.If your language is missing, and you would like to promote it, please open a ticket on the community forum.Note: Passbolt is currently translated only in French, however other languages such as German and Spanish are already in the works and will soon be available for translators and proofreaders.Translate strings or fix a translation errorOnce you have selected your language, you will be redirected to the CrowdIn translation editor.        fig. translation editorSelect a string that is not yet translated (‚ñ†) in the left panel ‚ë†. You can of course have access to all translated strings (‚ñ†) in the very same panel if you want to propose another translation.Translate the selected string from the central panel ‚ë°. CrowdIn will propose you suggestions ‚ë¢ to help translate but also to align with the tone and choice of words used in the application (suggestions marked with Passbolt‚Äôs Translation memory).If the strings to be translated are not clear you can request a context ‚ë£, the community or a translation manager will answer your question and can provide you with a screenshot where the strings are used if necessary.Access to the glossary or translation memory search tools are available if necessary in the right panel ‚ë§ of the application.Proofread passboltThe proofreading of passbolt is central in the translation process, it helps to keep a translation accurate andguarantee a global homogeneity of it. As for the translation the proofreading step is entirely managed by Crowdin.Become a proofreaderThe proofreader role can be requested to the passbolt team by email at contact@passbolt.com.The role attribution is made as per the following rules:      Contributors should have already proposed translations for the language they want to help with proofreading. If notranslation made on passbolt, the contributors can show contributions made on another open source project.        The already proposed translations should reflect the attention to details of the contributors and meet with the quality standard of passbolt.        The contributors should have proven good communication skills in their previous exchanges with the passbolt team as well as other contributors. See the passbolt code of conduct to know more about what is expected from the passbolt community members.  Access to the proofreading editorTo access to the proofreading editor from the translation editor:  Click on the hamburger ‚ò∞ in the top left of the CrowdIn translation editor.  Click on workflow.  Click on Proofreading.        fig. Crowdin editors switchProofread stringsOnce you have switched to the proofreading workflow you can start to review and approve translated strings.        fig. proofreading editorSelect a string that needs validation in the central panel ‚ë†.If the translation is correct, you can approve it ‚ë°. Sometimes multiple translations are proposed and are available in the right panel, in that case you can arbitrate them ‚ë¢ and select the one that works the best.If none of the translations are correct for the selected string you can either translate the string ‚ë£ yourselfor move to the next string.Externalize strings or fix source languageA string is available for translation only if it has been externalized in the source code of the passbolt applications, and the source code is already in the pre-release state.Note: As mentioned in the introduction of this document, British English is the language used to develop the application. Therefore, any changes to the source language will have to be done in the source code and each changewill have to go through the translation process.Externalize styleguide stringsThe styleguide repository contains most of the screens presented tothe end user.In this repository you will find:  Most of the passbolt front-end application in the directory src/react-extension  The passbolt quickaccess application in the directory src/react-quickaccessThe styleguide uses the i18next library to help manage the translation, if you want to know more checkout their documentation.Getting startedIn order to work on the translation of this application you need to:  Fork the repository.

"faq-hosting-how-to-increase-auto-logout-time": {
"title": "How to increase auto logout time?",
"category": "hosting",
"content": "By default passbolt uses the PHP session duration setting to define when the auto logout shouldkick in. If the default session timeout is too short for you and your user you can extend it in the PHP configuration.Currently, the code checks every 15 minutes if the browser is idle, using this browser functionality reserved for extensions, which returns ‚Äúlocked‚Äù if the system is locked, ‚Äúidle‚Äù if the user has not generated any input for a specified number of seconds, or ‚Äúactive‚Äù otherwise.So if there is no direct interaction with the extension, the extension will not try to keep the session alive, and will just let it timeout. So if you have a long session default normally you would need to fail several checks to get logged out.        Pro tip: If the browser window is closed (even if the browser application is not closed) you will get logged out right away.        The best way to keep your session active is via the remember me feature as shown here.        fig. Remember my passwordSee the directive session.gc-maxlifetimeIn order to change this number you must locate your php.ini file. Its location depends on youroperating system and php versions.For example on Debian or Ubuntu if you are using Nginx and PHP 7.4 it will be in/etc/php/7.4/fpm/php.ini but the easy way to find it is to execute this command:$ grep -lr session.gc_maxlifetime /etc/ | grep fpm/etc/php/7.4/fpm/php.iniOnce located replace the 1440 timout value in seconds with for example 2700 for 45 minutes:; After this number of seconds, stored data will be seen as 'garbage' and; cleaned up by the garbage collection process.; http://php.net/session.gc-maxlifetimesession.gc_maxlifetime = 2700Important: It‚Äôs really important to note that the browser extension is sending a request to the server in order to keep the session active, that means that any behaviour that is comprometting it will end the session, even if the session lifetime is not ended. We have noticed a short behaviour that will result in a session ended:  Internet connection lost  Browser shutdown  Computer shutdown  Computer‚Äôs session inactive (locked)  Changing IP address  Browser‚Äôs Confidentiality settings",

They generate self-signed certificates and trust them with their own Private Key Infrastructure (PKI).To trust SSL certificates signed by the PKI, you have to ensure root certificate of your company‚Äôs PKI has been added in your operating system keychain.Chain of trustA certificate chain or certificate CA bundle is a sequence of certificates, where each certificate in the chain is signed by the subsequent certificate.An intermediate certificate authority (CA) is an entity that can sign certificates on behalf of the root CA.The root CA is only ever used to create one or more intermediate CAs, which are trusted by the root CA to sign certificates on their behalf. This is best practice.Use-caseLet‚Äôs assume the following chain of trust:        fig. Chain of Trust  Your passbolt server certificate has been issued by ‚ÄúMy Intermediate CA‚Äù.  ‚ÄúMy Intermediate CA‚Äù has been issued by ‚ÄúMy Root CA‚ÄùTo make your passbolt certificate trusted on your system, you have to add the root CA to your operating system keychain.To manually check if your passbolt SSL certificate has been issued by the correct certificate authority, follow the procedure below.Display the chain of trustThis command will display the chain of trust for passbolt.domain.tld:openssl s_client -quiet -connect passbolt.domain.tld:443It returns:depth=2 CN = My Root CA, emailAddress = it@domain.tld, O = Your Company, OU = Your Company IT Team, L = Esch-Sur-Alzette, ST = Luxembourg, C = LUverify return:1depth=1 C = LU, ST = Luxembourg, O = Your Company, OU = Your Company IT Team, CN = My Intermediate CA, emailAddress = it@domain.tldverify return:1depth=0 CN = passbolt.domain.tld, emailAddress = it@domain.tld, O = Your Company, OU = Your Company IT Team, L = Esch-Sur-Alzette, ST = Luxembourg, C = LUverify return:1Where:  depth 2 is your root certificate CN=My Root CA  depth 1 is the intermediate certificate CN=My Intermediate CA  depth 0 is your certificate CN=passbolt.domain.tldCheck the chain of trustThis command will display all certificates of the chain of trust:openssl s_client -showcerts -connect passbolt.domain.tld:443Certificate chain 0 s:CN = passbolt.domain.tld, emailAddress = it@domain.tld, O = Your Company, OU = Your Company IT Team, L = Esch-Sur-Alzette, ST = Luxembourg, C = LU   i:C = LU, ST = Luxembourg, O = Your Company, OU = Your Company IT Team, CN = My Intermediate CA, emailAddress = it@domain.tld-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----(...)-----END CERTIFICATE----- 1 s:C = LU, ST = Luxembourg, O = Your Company, OU = Your Company IT Team, CN = My Intermediate CA, emailAddress = it@domain.tld   i:CN = My Root CA, emailAddress = it@domain.tld, O = Your Company, OU = Your Company IT Team, L = Esch-Sur-Alzette, ST = Luxembourg, C = LU-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----(...)-----END CERTIFICATE----- 2 s:CN = My Root CA, emailAddress = it@domain.tld, O = Your Company, OU = Your Company IT Team, L = Esch-Sur-Alzette, ST = Luxembourg, C = LU   i:CN = My Root CA, emailAddress = it@domain.tld, O = Your Company, OU = Your Company IT Team, L = Esch-Sur-Alzette, ST = Luxembourg, C = LU-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----(...)-----END CERTIFICATE-----            Warning: As it is not mandatory to expose root CA, it can be missing from the above command output.

You can check our SSL troubleshooting page for more details.Can I use a self-signed certificate with the mobile application ?The answer is yes. The mandatory part is to generate a certificate with a valid subjectAltName.How to generate a proper Self-signed certificate ?openssl req -x509 \\    -newkey rsa:4096 \\    -days 120 \\    -subj \"/C=LU/ST=Luxembourg/L=Esch-Sur-Alzette/O=Passbolt SA/OU=Passbolt IT Team/CN=passbolt.domain.tld/\" \\    -nodes \\    -addext \"subjectAltName = DNS:passbolt.domain.tld\" \\    -keyout key.pem \\    -out cert.pemThis command will output two files: key.pem and cert.pem.Of course, replace -subj values with your own. It is important to set your passbolt FQDN in both CN and subjectAltName.        Pro tip: You can use an IP address instead of a domain name for your self-signed certificate.

"content": "Sharing passwords using groups is already possible in passbolt and can help organise the passwords. It is often not enough for small teams or users with a lot of passwords, who often need another way to organise their data.How are tags different than categories?The major difference between categories and tags is that, in most systems using folders, a given item only belongs to one folder. Inversely, when tagging, one item can be linked to many tags. Also while it is possible to have a hierarchical tag structure it is also less common.        fig. Tags mental modelsUser experience and use casesYou will find tags in the passwords workspace:        fig. Tags in passwords workspace        fig.

This autocomplete is updated for each letter typed starting with the first one. When clicking on an autocomplete list item, the tag is added. It is possible to select autocomplete list items using keyboard keys.By default, tags are set to be personal. It is a way for users to organize their passwords (their own and shared ones) following their own personal classification. Any resource can be tagged by users as personal.If using the prefix ‚Äú#‚Äù a tag can be shared to everyone with access to this password. Users must be able to update a resource to be able to create a shared tag on it.        fig.

This will allow the user to associate a set of permissions to one or more folders, while reusing the metaphors the users are already accustomed to.Like resources, a folder must have an owner permission defined in the folder permissions. Two other permissions types are available: update and read. Each permission type give access to operations as described in the grid below:            Operation / Folder Permission      Owner      Update      Read                  View folder permissions      Yes      Yes      Yes              View folder      Yes      Yes      Yes              Rename folder      Yes      Yes      No              Delete folder      Yes      Yes      No              Create an item inside a folder      Yes      Yes      No              Move an item inside a folder      Yes      Yes      No              Edit folder permissions      Yes      No      No      Once an item is inside a folder what can be done with the items does not depend on the folder permission but the item itself, like on a regular file system. For a user to move an item that is inside a folder they must generally at least have update rights on the item and the destination folder.            Operation / Enclosed Item Permission      Owner      Update      Read                  Move an item outside the folder      Yes      Yes      Only in some cases. See Approach to personal &amp; shared folder organizations              Edit the resource      Yes      Yes      No              Delete the resource      Yes      Yes      No      Approach to folder permissions inheritanceOne of the key requirements is to be able to apply a given folder permission to the items inside it. For example when a user ‚Äúshare‚Äù a folder or create a new item in that folder, or drop an existing resource in a folder, the folder permissions will be applied to the items where possible.The ‚Äúwhere possible‚Äù is important here. While folders in passbolt can be used to organize resources and apply permissions, folders do not enforce the permission on its enclosed content at all times, but serve as a guide when an operation such as create or move is performed. As we have seen exceptions can be created, i.e. it is possible for a user to have more rights on an item than they have on a given folder. The opposite is also possible, the same way it is possible to create a hidden or restricted file in a shared folder in a traditional filesystem.One should picture a folder permission list as a permission mask, i.e. a predefined set of group/user rights, that could be applied to the folder content whenever a user is interacting with it. Applying permissions on a folder is the equivalent of selecting all the resources the user has the right to share inside the given folder and apply a new set of permission to this selection. Items where the user does not have access to (or cannot edit the permissions) will be ignored.This approach is also needed to work with the limitation of the end to end encryption scheme. Indeed only a user that has access to a secret can provide such access to another user.A user with can update as a permission is able to move a secret from one folder to another folder. In this case if the new folder is shared with more users these users won‚Äôt have the secret shared with them. This is because to share a secret a user needs to have the owner permission on the secret. To ensure a secret inherits the permissions you expect it is best to have a user with the owner permission move the secret to the new folder.Additional resources  Blog post: Introducing the new ‚ÄúFolders‚Äù feature (2020)  Folders functional specifications (2020)",

This procedure can also be used to configure passbolt on an additional machine.RequirementsYou can follow this procedure if you are meeting the following requirements:  You are in possession of an active account;  You are in possession of your recovery kit, it contains a copy of the private key associated to your account;  You remember your passphrase.If you lost your recovery kit or your passphrase and you subscribed to the account recovery program, checkout thisdocumentation.ProcedureStep 1. In order to recover you will need to go to your domain URL and add /recover at the end of the url,for example https://yourpassbolt.com/recover.Step 2. Complete the form by providing your email address.Step 3. Follow the link in your mailbox.Step 4. Follow the recovery steps, which is much like the initial setup. You will need to import your private key.Step 5. Enter your passphrase to login! Recover an account with the account recovery programAccount recovery is a feature introduced with passbolt v3.6.0 that as for aim to help users to recover their accountsin case of recovery kit or passphrase loss. To know more about account recovery, checkout this documentation.RequirementsYou can follow this procedure if you are meeting the following requirements:  You are in possession of an active account;  Your organisation is running passbolt Pro &gt; v3.6.0 or Passbolt Cloud.  You subscribed to the account recovery program while installing passbolt for the first time or via in your user settings workspace.ProcedureThere are 2 ways to start the procedure:  Assuming the browser extension is configured but the passphrase is lost: users can, at any time, click on the ‚Äúhelp, I lost my passphrase‚Äù link in the sign in screen. An email will be sent to them to start the procedure.        fig. Login screen with the account recovery feature  Assuming users are configuring Passbolt for a new browser or a new browser profile: during the process, they will be prompted to provide a recovery kit and its passphrase. If one of the information is missing, users can click on the ‚Äúhelp, I lost my private key‚Äù link. Users will receive an email to start the procedure.        fig. Recover screen with the help linkHow does the account recovery procedure look like      Users have asked for an account recovery and just received an email to start. The email contains a link that brings the users to the account recovery request page. Pay attention that at this moment, the browser being used must be the one on which the browser extension has to be configured to access the application. If the browser or profile is changed during the process users will be blocked at some point and might need to restart from the beginning.        Users are prompted to provide a new passphrase and set their security token. Please note that the chosen passphrase is not a temporary one and will be the new passphrase to sign in. It‚Äôs the same for the security token.        After these steps, an email is sent to the administrators to tell them that an account recovery has been requested. Users need to wait for them to accept the account recovery request (they could also reject it if they wish and users won‚Äôt be able to finish the recovery process).        If they reject or accept the request an email is sent to inform the users about their choice. If it‚Äôs accepted, the email contains a link that users can follow to go on with the account recovery procedure.        At this step, users are asked to provide the passphrase they chose previously. If they don‚Äôt remember it, they‚Äôre still able to request for another account recovery from the interface. After entering the right passphrase, the browser extension will sign the users in after ensuring they have downloaded their new recovery kit.  ",

NTP is important for two main reasons with Passbolt. The first is in regards to GPG authentication. The other area where this becomes important is if you have MFA enabled as if the server and user device time get out of sync the codes will not work.UbuntuOfficial Ubuntu DocumentationUbuntu uses chrony for time synchronization. This package is not installed by default so you‚Äôll need to install it.You can check that your server doesn‚Äôt have this enabled by running the following:timedatectl statusThe output should look something like the following:               Local time: Tue 2022-12-06 09:26:53 UTC           Universal time: Tue 2022-12-06 09:26:53 UTC                 RTC time: Tue 2022-12-06 09:26:52                Time zone: Etc/UTC (UTC, +0000)System clock synchronized: no              NTP service: inactive          RTC in local TZ: noThe two most important lines here being:System clock synchronized: no              NTP service: inactiveTo install chrony you‚Äôll need to run this command:sudo apt install chronyYou can configure which time servers you want to use by editing /etc/chrony/chrony.confAfter you are done editing this file run the following to restart chronysudo systemctl restart chrony.serviceTo ensure this is running correctly you can once again run:timedatectl statusYour output should now be something like:               Local time: Tue 2022-12-06 09:30:40 UTC           Universal time: Tue 2022-12-06 09:30:40 UTC                 RTC time: Tue 2022-12-06 09:30:40                Time zone: Etc/UTC (UTC, +0000)System clock synchronized: yes              NTP service: active          RTC in local TZ: noThe important lines are:System clock synchronized: yes              NTP service: activeIf only one of these has changed try running timedatectl status after another minute or two to give it time to be fully correct.Once those are both correct, congratulations you‚Äôve gotten NTP correctly set up!DebianOfficial Debian DocumentationA fresh Debian installation should already be properly configured for this.

YaST is featured in the openSUSE Linux distribution.To run yast you will need to run this command:sux yast2Once it is running, specify when to start the network time protocol service:  Only manuallyStart the Network Time Protocol service manually  Synchronize without DaemonSet the system time periodically without a permanently running Network Time Protocol service. You can set the Interval of the Synchronization in Minutes.  Now and on bootStart the Network Time Protocol service automatically when the system is booting. This setting is recommended.After this step, you will need to specify the type of configuration source. In the Configuration Source drop-down box, select either Dynamic or Static. Set Static if your server uses only a fixed set of (public) NTP servers. If your internal network offers NTP servers via DHCP, pick Dynamic.You need to configure time servers. Time servers for the client to query are listed in the lower part of the NTP Configuration window. Modify this list as needed by clicking Add, Edit, and Delete.After you clicked Add to add a new time server in the address field, type the URL of the time server or pool of time servers with which you want to synchronize the machine time (for example, europe.pool.ntp.org). After URL is complete, click on Test to verify that it points to a valid time source.You can active Quick initial Sync to speed up the time synchronization by sending more request at the Network Time Protocol service start or you can active Start Offline to speed up the boot time on systems that start the Network Time Protocol service automatically and may not have an internet connection at boot time.Now that we have configured Network Time Protocol with YaST we need to restart and enable chrony with:sudo systemctl restart chronyd.servicesudo systemctl enable chronyd.serviceOracle LinuxOfficial Oracle DocumentationTo configure Network Time Protocol On Oracle you need to install the NTP package:yum install ntpOnce NTP is installed, you will need to start the service and set it to launch automatically upon boot:service ntpd startchkconfig ntpd onYou can check upstream synchronization with the ntpq command:ntpq -pThe output should be something like this:     remote           refid      st t when poll reach   delay   offset  jitter============================================================================== lists2.luv.asn. 203.161.12.165  16 u   25   64    3    3.495   -3043.1   0.678 ns2.novatelbg.n 130.95.179.80   16 u   27   64    3   26.633   -3016.1   0.797 sp1.mycdn.fr    130.234.255.83  16 u   24   64    3    4.314   -3036.3   1.039FedoraOfficial Fedora DocumentationThe chrony suite is installed by default on some versions of Fedora, but you have two choices the other one being ntpd.Chrony should be considered as best match for the systems which are frequently suspended or otherwise intermittently disconnected from a network.The NTP daemon (ntpd) should be considered for systems which are normally kept permanently on.Install chrony on FedoraAs mentionned previously, chrony suite is installed by default on some versions of Fedora, to ensure that it is, run the following command as root:dnf install chronyThe default location for the chrony daemon is /usr/sbin/chronyd.

"content": "The importance of the installation methodThere are three main types of installations for Passbolt, and that‚Äôs what you need to know before running one of these commands as they may not work for each installation.  Package installation (Debian, Ubuntu, OracleLinux, and so on.)  From source  DockerWith package installation, the files will be split into two different directories, /etc/passbolt for the configuration files and /usr/share/php/passbolt for every other files and the CakePHP CLI.If you did a from source installation, the whole directory will be in /var/www/passbolt.If you are runnig docker, please, refer to the Troubleshoot Docker guide as all is explained there.APIHealthcheckThe healthcheck is used to check whether the Passbolt system is running as expected. It evaluates various aspects of the system to ensure that all components are working properly and configured correctly. It provides a detailed report about important information such as the gpg configuration, the ssl access, database configuration, etc.      Package Installation     sudo su -s /bin/bash -c \"/usr/share/php/passbolt/bin/cake passbolt healthcheck\" www-data            From source     sudo su -s /bin/bash -c \"/var/www/passbolt/bin/cake passbolt healthcheck\" www-data                  Pro tip: While running web server commands, it‚Äôs common to use www-data. However, this can vary based on your distribution. For example, nginx is used in distributions like CentOS, and httpd is used in distributions like Fedora. Always double-check what‚Äôs applicable for your specific setup to avoid errors.        DatacheckThe datacheck is a great tool as it aims to have a look at the data integrity for gpg keys, authentication tokens, groups, resources, etc.      Package Installation     sudo su -s /bin/bash -c \"/usr/share/php/passbolt/bin/cake passbolt datacheck\" www-data            From source     sudo su -s /bin/bash -c \"/var/www/passbolt/bin/cake passbolt datacheck\" www-data                  Pro tip: While running web server commands, it‚Äôs common to use www-data.

Always double-check what‚Äôs applicable for your specific setup to avoid errors.        Status ReportThe status report is in most case the best alternative if you need to gather information from the healthcheck, datacheck, do a cleanup dry-run and retrieve the server logs.On top of executing the healthcheck, datacheck and retrieving the server logs one after the other, it also gives important information about the system itself such as the passbolt edition and version, the version of CakePHP and PHP, composer version etc.      Package Installation     sudo su -s /bin/bash -c \"/usr/share/php/passbolt/bin/status-report\" www-data            From source     sudo su -s /bin/bash -c \"/var/www/passbolt/bin/status-report\" www-data                  Pro tip: While running web server commands, it‚Äôs common to use www-data.

If you are simply testing it, make sure not to perform an actual synchronization (use simulate sync instead), or disable the cron job to send emails first. Introduction What is it? The goal of the directory synchronization tool, also called LDAP connector, is to provide a way for a passboltadministrator to synchronize a list of groups and users, as well as the associated group memberships.

"content": "Important: The Ldap plugin is part of Passbolt Pro only and is not available in the Community Edition. Introduction What is it? The goal of the directory synchronization tool, also called LDAP connector, is to provide a way for a passboltadministrator to synchronize a list of groups and users, as well as the associated group memberships. Currently the connector supports two types of directory: OpenLDAP and Microsoft Active Directory. In the futurewe will also support other non ldap based user directories such as Google API User Directory. How does it work? In a nutshell this part of the application will try to keep passbolt and a directory in sync with a minimalinvolvement of the administrators and group managers. However if an action is not possible, such as, deletinga user that is the sole password owner, the process triggers will trigger relevant email notifications sothat a human can solve it manually....",
